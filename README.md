### Legal Research Chatbot


The Legal Research Chatbot is a Python-based tool designed to assist users with legal queries by retrieving information from PDF documents stored on Google Drive. It leverages machine learning techniques such as embeddings, document retrieval, and generative models for effective question answering.

### Key Features:
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF files using both OCR and text-based methods.
- **Embeddings Generation**: Converts document text into numerical embeddings for efficient search and retrieval.
- **Legal Query Answering**: Users can ask legal questions, and the system finds relevant documents and generates answers using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web application that allows users to interact with the chatbot and receive answers.

### Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following before running the project:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Drive API access for document storage
