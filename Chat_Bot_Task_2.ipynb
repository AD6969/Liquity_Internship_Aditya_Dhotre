In this connection Department of Posts require urgently the addresses of the nodal officers/central point in each Ministry/Organisation in need of their services as CAPIOs. The Department of Posts have also indicated that they will be in a position to undertake the work only on behalf of those Ministries who have completed this action and have informed them of the same.

However, this provision does not exempt these organizations from the purview of the Act in respect of the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights violations. Thus, the citizens have a right, though limited, to seek information from these organizations. Therefore, it is necessary that these organizations too designate Central Public Information Officers to deal with the RTI applications.\\n\\nThe Act does not contain any special provision about the method of supply of information 2. in respect of allegations of corruption by the above referred organizations. It, hovever, provides that information in respect of allegations of violation of human rights shall be given only after the approval of the Central Information Commission. In either case, it is possiblc that the applicant may not receive a decision within the time specified or he may be aggrieved by the decision communicated to him. In such a case, he may like to exercise his right to appeal as provided in section 19 of the Act.\\n\\nKeeping above facts in view, all the organizations specified in the Second Schedule of the 3. RTI Act, 2005 are advised to designate Central Public Information Officers (CPIO) immediately, if it has not been done so far.

The Second Administrative Reforms Commission in its First Report (June 2006) has observed that where a public authority designates more than one Public Information Officer (NO), an applicant is likely to face difficulty in approaching the appropriate Public Information Officer, and the applicants would also face problem in identifying the officer senior in rank to the PlO to whom an appeal under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act can be marie. (For convenience such an officer is termed as the First Appellate Authority). The Commission has, inter-a[ia, recommended that all Ministries! Departments/Agencies/Offices, with more than one P10, should designate a Nodal O±icer with the authority to receive requests for information on behalf of all PIOs. The Commission has also recommended that all the public authorities should designate the First Appellate Authorities.\\n\\n2. It is, therefore, requested that all public authorities with more than one PlO should create a central point within the organisation where all the RTI applications and the appeals ad&essed to the First Appellate Authorities may be received. An officer should be made responsible to ensure that all the RTT applications/appeals received at the central point are sent to the concerned Public Information Officers/Appellate Authorities, on the same day. For instance, the RTI applications/appeals may be received in the Receipt and Issue Section! Central Registry Section of the Ministry/Department /OrgansiationiAgeney and distributed to the concerned PIOs/Appellate Authorities. The R&I/CR Section may maintain a separate register for the purpose. The Officer-in-Charge/Branch Officer of the Section may ensure that the applications/appeals received are distributed the same day.\\n\\n13/19 1\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\nSub-section (8) of Section 7 of the RTI Act provides that where a request 3. for information is rejected, the Public Information Officer shall, inter-alia, communicate to the person making the request the particulars of the Appellate Authority. Thus, the applicant is informed about the particulars of the Appellate Authority when a request for information is rejected. There may be cases where the Public Information Officer does not reject the application, but the applicant does not receive a decision within the time as specified in the Act or he is aggrieved by the decision of the Public Information Officer. In such cases the applicant may like to exercise his right to appeal. But in absence of the particulars of the appellate authority, the applicant may face difficulty in making an appeal. It has, therefore, been decided that all the public authorities shall designate the First Appellate Authorities and publish their particulars alongwith the particulars of the PIOs.\\n\\n4.

The undersigned is directed to say that the responsibility of a public authority and its public information information officers (PlO) is not confined to furnish but also to provide necessary help to the information seeker, wherever necessary. While providing information or rendering help to a person, it is important to be courteous to the information seeker and to respect his dignity.\\n\\nMany organizations/training institutions are conducting 2. training programmes on the Right to Information Act. The public authorities should ensure that their PlOs and other concerned officers are exposed to such training programmes. The public authorities may also organize training programmes at their own level. While imparting such training, the officers should be sensitized about the need of courteous behaviour with the information seekers.\\n\\nThe Commission has also expressed concern over the fact 3. that many public authorities have not published relevant information under section 4 of the Act. All the public authorities should ensure that they make suo motu disclosure as provided in the Act without any further delay.

On the other hand sub-section (3) of Section 7 provides the procedure which a PlO has to follow for realizing the fee prescribed under sub-sections (1) and (5) of the Section Details of fees that can be charged by a public authority under the Central Government are contained in the Right to h,forrnation (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005. The Rules or the Act do not give power to the PlO to charge any fee other than prescribed in the Fee and Cost Rules. Attention in this regard is invited to following extracts from the common order passed by the Central Information Commission in Appeal No. CICIMNAJ200B/0185 (Shri K.K. Kishore Vs. Institute of Company Secretaries of India) and Complaint No.ClCtWBlCl2007/00943 (Shri Subodh Jam Vs. Dy. Commissioner of Police):\\n\\n\"The Act under proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 7 also provides that fee prescribed under sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 7 shall be reasonable and no such fee shall be charged from the persons who are below poverty The line as may be determined by the Appropriate Government. Government has already prescribed fees as deemed reasonable mandated under Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act and in the view of the Commission, there is no provision for any further fee apart from the one already prescribed under Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act\".\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n22/191\\n\\n11/13/202 i-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n\\n0\\n\\n:2:-\\n\\n\"Thus, there is provision for charging of fee only under Section 6(1) which is the application fee; Section 7(1) which is the fee charged for photocopying etc. and Section 7 (5) which is for getting information in printed or electronic format. But there is no provision for any further fee and if any further fee is being charged by the Public Authorities in addition to what is already prescribed under Section 6(1), 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act, the same would be in contravention of the Right to Information Act. The further fee\\' mentioned in Section 7(3) only refers to the procedure in availing of the further fee already prescribed under 7(5) of the RTI Act, which is \"further\" in terms of the basic fee of Rs.1O/- . Section 7(3), therefore, provides for procedure for realizing the fees so prescribed\".\\n\\nThe Commission, while delivering decision in above cases, recommended to 3. this Department to make rules, for charging fee towards supply of information which may include fee for supply of books, maps, plans, documents, samples, models etc. that are priced and towards postallcourier charges for mailing information, when postal/courier charges are in excess of minimum slab prescribed by the Department of Posts arid for other similar situations.\\n\\n4. The Right to Information (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005 already provide provisions for chargtng of fee for giving information in diskettes or floppies or in the form of photo copy; for providing samples, models, printed material like books, maps, plans etc; and for inspection of records. The Government have, however, not considered it desirable to charge fee towards expenditure involved in mailing information or overhead expenditure etc. Nevertheless, supply of information in a form which would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority is taken care of by Section 7(9) of the Act according to which information shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is sought but supply of information in a particular form may be refused if supply of information in that form would divert the resources of the public authority disproportionately.\\n\\nIlls hereby clarified that where a Public Information Officer takes a decision to 5. provide information on payment of fee in addition to the application fee, he should determine the quantum of such fee in accordance with the fee prescribed under the Fee arid Cost Rules referred to above and give the details of such fee to The applicant together with the calculation made to arrive at such fee. Since the Act or the Rules do not provide for charging of fee towards postal expenses or cost involved in deployment of man power for supply of information etc., he should not ask the applicant to pay fee on such account. However, wherever supply of information in a particular form would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the records, the PlO may refuse to supply the information in that form.\\n\\n23/191\\n\\n11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I\\n\\n2522461/2023 /IR-1\\n\\n:3 :-\\n\\n6.\\n\\nContents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concerned.\\n\\n\\'U.\\n\\n(KG.

If the information sought is not voluminous or is not dispersed over a large number of files, computation of the photocopying charges should not be a time consuming task.

It has been brought to the notice of this Department that some PIOs, using the above provision of the Act, transfer the RTI applications received by them to other officers and direct them to send information to the applicants as deemed PlO.

According to sub-section (3) of section 6 of the RTI Act, if an application is received by a public authority seeking an information which is held by another public authority or which is more closely connected with the subject matter relating to another public authority, the public authority receiving the application should transfer the application to the concerned public authority. It may be pointed out here that the Prime Minister\\'s Office has been assigned the work of providing secretariat assistance to the Prime Minister. After a decision is taken in a matter, the Ministry/Department to which the matter concerns takes further action regarding issue of orders etc. Naturally, the information in such cases would be available with the concerned Ministry/Department and not the PMO. The CPIO receiving the application should carefully see the subject matter in the RTI application and transfer it, if need be, to the concerned public authority and not to the PMO simply because the applicant has made a reference to the PM or PMO.\\n\\n2. this OM to the notice of all the Central Public Information Officers\\n\\nAll the Ministries/Departments etc. are requested to bring the contents of\\n\\n\\n\\nV / (K. 0.

Some times, such an information is sought, a part or no part of which is available with the public authority to which the application is made and remaining or whole of the information concerns another public authority or many other public authorities. A question has arisen as to how to dral with such cases.\\n\\n\\'Section 6(1) of the RTI Act, 2005 provides that a person who desires to obtain 2. any in formation shall make a request to the public information officer (PlO) of the concerned public authority. Section 6(3) provides that where an application is made to a public authority requesting for any information which is held by another public authority or the subject matter of which is more closely connected with the functions of another public authority, the public authority to which such application is made, shall transfer the application to that other public authority. A careful reading of the provisions of sub-section (1) and sub-section(3) of Section 6, suggests that the Act requires an information seeker to address the application to the PlO of the \\'concerned public authority\\'. However, there may be cases in which a person of o\\' dinary prudence may believe that the piece of information sought by him/her would t,e available with the public authority to which he/she has addressed the application, \\'out is actually held by some another public authority. In such cases, the applicant makes a bonafide mistake of addressing the application to the PlO of a wrong public authority. On the other hand where an applicant addresses the application to the PlO of a public authority, which to a person of ordinary prudence, would not appear to be the concern of that public authority, the applicant does not fulfill his responsibility of addressing the application to the \\'concerned public authority\\'.\\n\\n.2/-\\n\\n68/191\\n\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n\\n11/13/2021-I R-I\\n\\n:2:-\\n\\n3. reqwred to be taken by the public authorities in such cases:\\n\\nGiven hereinunder are some situations which may arise in the matter and action\\n\\n(I)\\n\\nA person makes an application to a public authority for some information which concerns some another public authority. In such a case, the PlO receiving the application should transfer the application to the concerned public authority under intimation to the applicant. However, if the PlO of the public authority is not able to find out as to which public authority is concerned with the information even after making reasonable efforts to find out the concerned public authority, he should inform the applicant that the information is not available with that public authority and that he is not aware of the particulars of the concerned public authority to which the application could be transferred. It would, however, be the responsibility of the PlO, if an appeal is made against his decision, to establish that he made reasonable efforts to find out the particulars of the concerned public authority.\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nA person makes an application to a public authority for information, only a part of which is available with that public authority and a part of the information concerns some \\'another public authority.\\' In such a case, the PlO should supply the information available with him and a copy of the application should be sent to that another public authority under intimation to the applicant.\\n\\n(iii) A person makes an application to a public authority for information, a part of which is available with that public authority and the rest of the information is scattered with more than one other public authorities. In such a case, the PlO of the public authority receiving the application should give information relating to it and advise the applicant to make separate applications to the concerned public authorities for obtaining information from them. If no part of the information sought, is available with it but is scattered with more than one other public authorities, the PlO should inform the applicant that information is not available with the public authority and that the applicant should make separate applications to the concerned public authorities for obtaining information from them. It may be noted that the Act requires the supply of such information only which already exists and is held by the public authority or held under the control of the public authority. It is beyond the scope of the Act for a public authority to create information. Collection of information, parts of which are available with different public authorities, would amount to creation of information which a public authority under the Act is not required to do. At the same time, since the information is not related to any one particular public authority, it Is not the case where application should be transferred under sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Act. It is pertinent to note that sub-section (3) refers to \\'another public authority\\' and not \\'other public authorities\\'. Use of singular form in the Act in this regard Is important to note.\\n\\n.3/-\\n\\n69/19 1\\n\\n2522461 / 2023,\\'i R- I\\n\\n4.\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n\\n:3\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nIf a person makes an application to a public authority for some information which is the concern of a public authority under any State Government or the Union Territory Administration, the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the public authority receiving the application should inform the applicant that the information may be had from the concerned State GovernrrentfUT Administration.

It need be noted that the sub-section simply means that if the information is sought in the form of photocopy, it shall be provided in the form of photocopy and if it is sought in the form of a floppy, it shall be provided in that form subject to the conditions given in the Act etc. It does not mean that the PlO shall re-shape the information.\\n\\nAccording to section 2(f) of the Act \\'information\\' means \\'any material in 2. any form\\'. A citizen, under the Act, has a right to get \\'material\\' from a public authority which is held by or under the control of that public authority. The right includes inspection of work, documents, records; taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records; taking certified samples of material; taking information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device. Careful reading of the definition of \\'information\\' and \\'right to information\\' makes it clear that a citizen has a right to get the material, inspect the material, take notes from the material, take extracts or certified copies of the material, take samples of the material, take the material in. the form of diskettes etc. The PlO is required to supply such material to the citizen who seeks it.

Further, it requires the Government to update the guide at regular intervals. Accordingly a Guide on the Act was published online on 28.11.2013 to help all the stake-holders viz, information seekers in getting information, public information officers in dealing with the RTI applications, first appellate authorities in taking cogent decisions on appeals and the public authorities in implementing various provisions of the Act in right earnest.\\n\\nThe Public Information Officers/First Appellate Authorities should keep in 2. mind the salient features of the guidelines in supply of information to the information seeker and disposal of first appeal respectively, so that information seekers may not resort to filing of second appeals before the Information Commissions. The relevant salient features of the guidelines are reiterated below for consideration of the Public Information Officers and First Appellate\\n\\nAuthorities:\\n\\nSupply of Information by the Public Information Officer\\n\\n1)\\n\\nThe answering Public Information Officer should check whether the information sought or a part thereof is exempt from disclosure under Section 8 or Section 9 of the Act.

It is very important that the order passed by the first appellate authority should be a detailed and speaking order, giving justification for the decision arrived at.\\n\\n2)\\n\\nIf an appellate authority while deciding an appeal comes to a conclusion that the appellant should be supplied information in\\n\\n2\\n\\n94/19 1\\n\\n11 / 1 3/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\naddition to what has been supplied by the Public Information Officer, he may either (1) pass an order direcflng the Public Information Officer to give such informaf ion to the appellant; or (ii) he himself may give information to the appellant.

It is a gigantic task which requires involvement of various sections of society. Non- Governmental Organisations are providing various kinds of services to the people and creating awareness amongst them. They come in close contact with the public and may play an important role in disseminating knowledge about the use of the Right to Information Act. You are, therefore requested to involve the Non-Governmental Organisations working in your State to spread awareness about the Act.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n(K.G.

In exceptional cases, the appellate authority may take forty five days to dispose off the appeal subject to the condition that he shall record in writing the reasons for delay in deciding the appeal. Therefore, each first appellate authority should ensure that an appeal received by him is disposed off within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal. If, in some exceptional cases, it is not possible to dispose off the appeal within 30 days, its disposal should not take more than 45 days. In such cases, the appellate authority should record, in writing, the reasons for not deciding the appeal within 30 days.\\n\\n3. Deciding appeals under the RTL Act is a quasi-judicial function. It is, therefore, necessary that the appellate authority should see to it that the justice is not only done but it should also appear to have been done. In order to do so, the order passed by the appellate authority should be a speaking order giving justification for the decision arrived at.\\n\\n101/191\\n\\n252 2461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n11/ 13/2021-IR-I\\n\\nIt\\' an appellate authori.y comes to a conclusion that the appellant should be 4. supplied information in addition to what has been supplied to him by the CPIO. he may either (I) pass an order directing the CPIO to give such information to the appellant; or (ii) he himself may give information to the appellant while disposing off the appeal. In the first case the appellate authority should ensure that the information ordered by him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately. It would, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the second course of action and he himself furnishes the information alongwith the order passed by him in the matter.\\n\\nThe Central In formation Commission has also pointed out that some of the 5. Ministries/Departments have appointed very junior officers as appellate authorities who are not in a position to enforce their orders. The Act provides that the first appellate authority would be an officer senior in rank to the CPIO. Thus, the appellate authority, as per provisions of the Act, would be an officer in a commanding position vis-à-vis the CPIO. Nevertheless, if, in any case, the CPIO does not implement the order passed by the appellate authority and the appellate authority feels that intervention of higher authority is required to get his order implemented, he should bring the matter to the notice of the officer in the public authority competent to take against the CPIO. Such competent officer shall take necessary action so as to ensure implementation of the provisions of the RTI Act.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nContents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concej\\n\\n(KG.

The \\'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012\\'\\n\\nunder formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus.\\n\\nb) Websites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of\\n\\ndelivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens.\\n\\nc) Orders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after\\n\\nthey have been issued.\\n\\nd) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents\\n\\nwhich are normally accessed by citizens.\\n\\n116/191\\n\\n2522461/2023/JR-I\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\ne) Websites should have detaed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the\\n\\nPublic Authority.\\n\\nf)\\n\\nIt is obligatory under Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority to\\n\\nproactively disclose \\'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it,\\n\\nreduced in an electronic form\\'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally\\n\\nheld information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not.\\n\\ng) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for\\n\\nelectronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due\\n\\ntransparency as provided in the RTI Act is given adequate consideration at the design\\n\\nstage itself.\\n\\nh) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information\\n\\ngeneration in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key\\n\\nwork outputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (NREGA in Andhra Pradesh) or\\n\\nformalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to\\n\\nautomation of proactive disclosure.\\n\\ni) Information must be presented from a user\\'s perspective, which may require re-\\n\\narranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats\\n\\nshould continue to be made available because these are needed for community\\n\\nmonitoring of government\\'s functioning.\\n\\nj) The \\'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy by the Department of Science\\n\\nand Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should\\n\\nbe readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule\\n\\nshould be strictly adhered to.\\n\\nk) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be\\n\\npulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions\\n\\nmore appropriate to specific contexts and needs. lnformation/ data can, for\\n\\ninstance, be presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such\\n\\nvisual representation of information/ data can give insights that may remain largely\\n\\n5\\n\\n117/191\\n\\n1 1 / 1 3/ 202 1-IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n\\nhidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and\\n\\naudio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some\\n\\nparts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA\\n\\nworksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media\\n\\nand forms should be used for proactive disclosure.\\n\\nI) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the RTI\\n\\nAct should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field \\'Date last updated\\n\\n(DD/MM/YY)\\'.\\n\\n118/19 1\\n\\n1 1 / 1 3/2021-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n\\n3.0\\n\\nGuidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nThe elements of information listed in the variou5 sub-clauses of Section 4(1)(b) must\\n\\nbe disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a\\n\\npublic authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its\\n\\nemployees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions\\n\\nand manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element\\n\\npresupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to\\n\\nintegrate the information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary\\n\\ndisclosure materials.\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nConsidering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively\\n\\nweak, detailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below:\\n\\n3.3 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - \"the procedure followed in the decision-making\\n\\nprocesses, including channels of supervision and accountability\".\\n\\n3.3.1 All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the\\n\\nrespective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The\\n\\nconstitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly\\n\\nlaid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each\\n\\nDepartment/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally,\\n\\nevery department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes\\n\\nwhich they are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other\\n\\ndesignated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public\\n\\nAuthority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or\\n\\nscheme. Every operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a\\n\\nspecific decision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office\\n\\nprocedure manual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions\\n\\nand applications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of\\n\\ndecision-making are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the\\n\\nelements of decision-making processes in general.\\n\\nU\\n\\n119/19 1\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n\\n3.3.2 Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are\\n\\n0(cid:9)\\n\\nrequired to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid\\n\\ndown in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down\\n\\nprocedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must\\n\\nbe accorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how\\n\\nresponsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for\\n\\ngrants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed;\\n\\nhow commodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in\\n\\nthese manuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified\\n\\nversion of the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen.\\n\\n3.3.3 In view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n(a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs! tangible\\n\\nresults! services! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the\\n\\npublic or to whosoever is the client of the public authority.\\n\\n(b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of\\n\\na flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public functionaries involved in the\\n\\ndecision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy.\\n\\n(c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates\\n\\ninvolved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart\\n\\nor in a simple bullet-pointed format in a text-box. The exceptional circumstances\\n\\nwhen such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom,\\n\\nshould also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has\\n\\noccurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures\\n\\nmust also be clearly explained.\\n\\n(d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and\\n\\ndiscretionary operations that are part of the public authority\\'s mandate under the\\n\\nAOB read with the TOB.\\n\\n120/191\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n(e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or\\n\\nadopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple\\n\\nlanguage in order to enable people to easily understand the changes made.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - \"the norms set by it for the discharge of its\\n\\nfunctions\".\\n\\n3.4.1 Primarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively\\n\\ndisclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be\\n\\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure\\n\\ncompliance with this clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major\\n\\nfunctions that are being performed.\\n\\n3.4.2 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central\\n\\nMinistry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down\\n\\nnorms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those\\n\\nstandards.\\n\\n3.4.3 Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute\\n\\nor government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with\\n\\nthe decision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively\\n\\ndisclose the following:\\n\\na) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office\\n\\nprovides directly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor).\\n\\nb) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or\\n\\nreceive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public\\n\\nauthority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the\\n\\napplicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online),\\n\\nwherever available, should be given.\\n\\nc) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes\\n\\neligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people\\n\\nwho are entitled to receive the goods and services.\\n\\n121/191\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-lR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n\\nd) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,)\\n\\nand timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to\\n\\nthe public.\\n\\ne) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public\\n\\nauthority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was\\n\\nobligated to provide.\\n\\nf) Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who is\\n\\nresponsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible for supervision).\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- \"the budget allocated to each of its agency,\\n\\nindicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on\\n\\ndisbursements made\".\\n\\n3.5.1 The public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following:\\n\\n(a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential\\n\\nthat Ministries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can\\n\\nbe understood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets\\n\\nand their periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly\\n\\nmanner through graphs and tables, etc.\\n\\n(b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India\\n\\nshould be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identify physical targets\\n\\nplanned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those\\n\\ntargets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being\\n\\nfollowed in Karnataka is a useful model.\\n\\n(c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/\\n\\nattached offices! Public Sector Enterprises! Societies! NG0s/ Corporations etc.\\n\\nshould be put on the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities\\n\\nmay be made accessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department.\\n\\nIf a subsidiary does not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of\\n\\n10\\n\\n122/191\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n\\nsuch subsidiary authárity may be uploaded on the vjebsite of the principal Public\\n\\nAuthority.\\n\\n(d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and\\n\\nachievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be\\n\\nhighlighted. For example, budget allocation and target focusing on gender, children,\\n\\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities should be specially\\n\\nhighlighted. The sector-wise breakup of these targets and actual outcomes must be\\n\\ngiven in simplified form to enable the vulnerable segments of society to better\\n\\nunderstand the budgets of public authorities.\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) — details in respect of information, available to\\n\\nor held by it, reduced in an electronic form.\\n\\n3.6.1 On the one hand, this clause serves as a means of proactively disclosing the progress\\n\\nmade in computerizing information under Section 4(1)(a) of the RTI Act in a periodic\\n\\nmanner. On the other, it provides people with clarity about the kinds of electronic\\n\\ninformation that, although not held by the public authority, is available to them. For\\n\\nexample the stocks of ration available with individual fair price shops may not be held by the\\n\\nDistrict Civil Supplies office, but may be available at a subordinate formation.\\n\\n3.6.2 Keeping in view the varied levels of computerization of records and documents in\\n\\npublic authorities, data about records that have been digitized may be proactively disclosed\\n\\non the respective websites, excluding those records /files /information that are exempted\\n\\nunder Section 8. The data about digitized record may include the name of the record and\\n\\nany categorization or indexing used; the subject matter and any other information that is\\n\\nrequired to be compiled in relation to a file as prescribed by Manual of Office Procedure\\n\\n(and to be prescribed by MOP for electronic records that is under finalization by DARPG),\\n\\nthe division! section/ unit! office where the record is normally held; the person, with\\n\\ndesignation, responsible for maintaining the record; and the life span of the record, as\\n\\nprescribed in the relevant record retention schedule.\\n\\n11\\n\\n123/19 1\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-1\\n\\n252?461/2023/IR-1\\n\\n4.0\\n\\nCompliance with Provisions of suo motu (proactive) disclosure under the RTI Act\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nEach Ministry/Public Authority shall ensure that these guidelines are fully\\n\\noperationalized within a period of 6 months from the date of their issue.\\n\\n4.2\\n\\nProactive disclosure as per these guidelines would require collating a large quantum\\n\\nof information and digitizing it. For this purpose, Ministries/Public Authorities may engage\\n\\nconsultants or outsource such work to expeditiously comply with these guidelines. For this\\n\\npurpose, the plan/non-plan funds of that department may be utilized.\\n\\n4.3\\n\\nThe Action Taken Report on the compliance of these guidelines should be sent, along\\n\\nwith the URL link, to the DoPT and Central Information Commission soon after the expiry of\\n\\nthe initial period of 6 months.\\n\\n4.4\\n\\nEach Ministry! Public Authority should get its proactive disclosure package audited\\n\\nby third party every year. The audit should cover compliance with the proactive disclosure\\n\\nguidelines as well as adequacy of the items included in the package. The audit should\\n\\nexamine whether there are any other types of information which could be proactively\\n\\ndisclosed. Such audit should be done annually and should be communicated to the Central\\n\\nInformation Commission annually through publication on their own websites. All Public\\n\\nAuthorities should proactively disclose the names of the third party auditors on their\\n\\nwebsite. For carrying out third party audit through outside consultants also,\\n\\nMinistries/Public Authorities should utilize their plan/non-plan funds.\\n\\n4.5\\n\\nThe Central Information Commission should examine the third-party audit reports\\n\\nfor each Ministry/Public Authority and offer advice/recommendations to the concerned\\n\\nMinistries/ Public Authorities.\\n\\n4.6\\n\\nCentral Information Commission should carry out sample audit of few of the\\n\\nMinistries/ Public Authorities each year with regard to adequacy of items included as well as\\n\\ncomplianceof the Ministry/Public Authority with these guidelines.\\n\\n4.7\\n\\nCompliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines, its audit by third party and its\\n\\ncommunication to the Central Information Commission should be included as RFD target.\\n\\n12\\n\\n124/191\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n\\n5.0\\n\\nNodal Officer\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nEach Central Ministry/ Public Authority should appoint a senior officer not below the\\n\\nrank of a Joint Secretary and not below rank of Additional HOD in case of attached offices\\n\\nfor ensuring compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines. The Nodal Officer would\\n\\niork under the supervision of the Secretary of the Ministry/Department or the HOD of the\\n\\nattached office, as the case may be. Nodal Officers of Ministry/Department and HOD\\n\\nseparately should also ensure that the formations below the Ministry/Department/Attached\\n\\nOffice also disclose the information as per the proactive disclosure guidelines.\\n\\n6.0 Annual Reports to Parliament/Legislatures\\n\\n6.1\\n\\nGovernment has issued directions to all Ministries/Departments to include a chapter\\n\\non RTl Act in their Annual Reports submitted to the Parliament.

Information to be disclosed proactively may contain nature of the official tour, places\\n\\nvisited, the period, number of people included in the official delegation and total cost of such\\n\\ntravel undertaken. Exemptions under Section 8 of the RTI Act, 2005 may be kept in view\\n\\nwhile disclosing the information. These instructions would not apply to security and\\n\\nintelligence organisations under the second schedule of the RTI Act, 2005 and CVOs of\\n\\npublic authorities.\\n\\n137/19 1\\n\\n1 1/13/2021-IR-1\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nGuidelines for digital publication of proactive disclosure under Section 4\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nSection 4 lays down that information should be provided through many mediums\\n\\ndepending upon the level of the public authority and the recipient of information (for\\n\\nexample, in case of Panchayat, wall painting may be more effective means of dissemination\\n\\nof information), and that more and more proactive disclosure would gradually be made\\n\\nthrough Internet. There is need for more clear guidelines for web-based publication of\\n\\ninformation for disclosure.\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nThe Department of Information Technology has been working on setting of technical\\n\\nstandards for government websites and the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public\\n\\nGrievances has published guidelines for websites of Government Departments. These\\n\\nguidelines prescribe the manner in which websites need to be designed and how information\\n\\nshould be disclosed. While adhering to the standards of government guidelines as laid down\\n\\nby Department of Information Technology and Department of Administrative Reforms &\\n\\nPublic Grievances, the following principles additionally should also be kept in view to ensure\\n\\nthat websites\\' disclosures are complete, easily accessible, technology and platform neutral\\n\\nand in a form which conveys the desired information in an effective and user-friendly\\n\\nmanner.\\n\\na) It should be the endeavor of all public authorities that all entitlements to citizens and\\n\\nall transactions between the citizen and government are gradually made available\\n\\nthrough computer based interface. The \\'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012\\'\\n\\nunder formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus.\\n\\nb) Vebsites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of\\n\\ndelivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens.\\n\\nc Orders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after\\n\\nthey have been issued.\\n\\nd) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents which\\n\\nare normally accessed by citizens.\\n\\n138/91 (7 )\\n\\n11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I\\n\\n2522461 / 2023 / I R- I\\n\\ne) Websites should have detailed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the\\n\\nPublic Authority.\\n\\nf) It is obligatory under Section 4(l)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority\\n\\nto proactively disclose \\'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it,\\n\\nreduced in an electronic form\\'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally\\n\\nheld information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not.\\n\\ng) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for\\n\\nelectronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due\\n\\ntransparency as provided in the Rh Act is given adequate consideration at the design\\n\\nstage itself.\\n\\nh) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information\\n\\ngeneration in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key work\\n\\noutputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (REGA in Andhra Pradesh) or\\n\\nformalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to\\n\\nautomation of proactive disclosure.\\n\\ni) Information must be presented from a user\\'s perspective, which may require re-\\n\\narranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats\\n\\nshould continue to be made available because these are needed for community\\n\\nmonitoring of government\\'s functioning.\\n\\nj) The \\'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy\\' by the Department of Science\\n\\nand Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should\\n\\nbe readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule\\n\\nshould be strictly adhered to.\\n\\nk) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be\\n\\npulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions\\n\\nmore appropriate to specific contexts and needs. Information! data can, for instance,\\n\\nbe presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such visual\\n\\nrepresentation of information! data can give insights that may remain largely\\n\\n9\\n\\n139/19 1\\n\\n2522461 / 2023 / I R- I\\n\\n11/13/ 202 i-IR-I\\n\\nhidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and\\n\\naudio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some\\n\\nparts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA\\n\\nworksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media\\n\\nand forms should be used for proactive disclosure.\\n\\nI) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the Rh\\n\\nAct should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field \\'Date last updated\\n\\n(DD/MM/YY)\\'.\\n\\n140/191 (7\\n\\n1\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522461 / Zö2 3 / I R- I\\n\\n3.0\\n\\nGuidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nThe elements of information listed in the various sub-clauses of Section 4(1 )(b) must\\n\\nbe disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a\\n\\npublic authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its\\n\\nemployees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions\\n\\nand manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element\\n\\npresupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to integrate\\n\\nthe information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary disclosure\\n\\nmaterials.\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nConsidering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively weak,\\n\\ndetailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below:\\n\\n33 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - \"the procedure followed in the decision-making\\n\\nprocesses, including channels of supervision and accountability\".\\n\\n3.3.1 All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the\\n\\nrespective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The\\n\\nconstitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly\\n\\nlaid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each\\n\\nDepartment/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally,\\n\\nevery department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes which\\n\\nthey are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other\\n\\ndesignated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public\\n\\nAuthority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or scheme.\\n\\nEvery operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a specific\\n\\ndecision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office procedure\\n\\nmanual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions and\\n\\napplications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of decision-\\n\\nmaking are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the elements of\\n\\ndecision-making processes in general.\\n\\n141/191\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n332 Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are\\n\\nrequired to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid\\n\\ndown in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down\\n\\nprocedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must be\\n\\naccorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how\\n\\nresponsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for\\n\\ngrants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed; how\\n\\ncommodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in these\\n\\nmanuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified version\\n\\nof the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen.\\n\\n333\\n\\nIn view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n(a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs/ tangible results!\\n\\nservices! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the public or to\\n\\nwhosoever is the client of the public authority.\\n\\n(b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of\\n\\na flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public ftinctionaries involved in the\\n\\ndecision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy.\\n\\n(c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates\\n\\ninvolved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart\\n\\nor in a simple bullet-pointed format in a.text-box. The exceptional circumstances\\n\\nwhen such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom,\\n\\nshould also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has\\n\\noccurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures\\n\\nmust also be clearly explained.\\n\\n(d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and\\n\\ndiscretionary operations that are part of the public authority\\'s mandate under the AOB\\n\\nread with the TOB.\\n\\nII\\n\\n142/191\\n\\nCl\\n\\n11/13/2021-I R-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n(e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or\\n\\nadopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple language\\n\\nin order to enable people to easily understand the changes made.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - \"the norms set by it for the discharge of its\\n\\nfunctions\".\\n\\n3.4.1\\n\\nPrimarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively\\n\\ndisclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be qualitative\\n\\nor quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure compliance with\\n\\nthis clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major functions that are being\\n\\nperformed.\\n\\n3.42 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central\\n\\nMinistry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down\\n\\nnorms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those\\n\\nstandards.\\n\\n3.43 Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute\\n\\nor government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with the\\n\\ndecision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively\\n\\ndisclose the following:\\n\\na) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office provides\\n\\ndirectly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor).\\n\\nb) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or\\n\\nreceive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public\\n\\nauthority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the\\n\\napplicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online),\\n\\nwherever available, should be given.\\n\\nc) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes\\n\\neligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people who\\n\\nare entitled to receive the goods and services.\\n\\n143/19 1\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522463 / 2023 / I R-I\\n\\nd) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,)\\n\\nand timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to\\n\\nthe public.\\n\\ne) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public\\n\\nauthority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was\\n\\nobligated to provide.\\n\\nf Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who\\n\\nis responsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible forsupervision).\\n\\n33\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- \"the budget allocated to each of its agency,\\n\\nindicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on\\n\\ndisbursements made\".\\n\\n35.1\\n\\nThe public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following:\\n\\n(a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential that\\n\\nMinistries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can be\\n\\nunderstood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets and\\n\\ntheir periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly\\n\\nmanner through graphs and tables, etc.\\n\\n(b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India\\n\\nshould be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identi\\' physical targets\\n\\nplanned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those\\n\\ntargets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being\\n\\nfollowed in Karnataka is a useful model.\\n\\n(c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/ attached\\n\\noffices/ Public Sector Enterprises/ Societies/ NGOs/ Corporations etc. should be put\\n\\non the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities may be made\\n\\naccessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department. If a subsidiary\\n\\ndoes not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of\\n\\n/3\\n\\n144/19 1\\n\\n7 0 (_) 0\\n\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n\\n2522461 / 2o2\\' I R- I\\n\\nsuch subsidiary authority may be uploaded on the website of the principal Public\\n\\nAuthority.\\n\\n(d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and\\n\\nachievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be\\n\\nhighlighted. For example, budget allocation and target focusing on gender, children,\\n\\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities should be specially\\n\\nhighlighted. The sector-wise breakup of these targets and actual outcomes must be\\n\\ngiven in simplified fonn to enable the vulnerable segments of society to better\\n\\nunderstand the budgets of public authorities.\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nGuidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) — details in respect of information, available to\\n\\nor held by it, reduced in an electronic form.\\n\\n36.1 On the one hand, this clause serves as a means of proactively disclosing the progress\\n\\nmade in computerizing information under Section 4(l)(a) of the RTI Act in a periodic\\n\\nmanner. On the other, it provides people with clarity about the kinds of electronic information\\n\\nthat, although not held by the public authority, is available to them, For example the stocks of\\n\\nration available with individual fair price shops may not be held by the District Civil Supplies\\n\\noffice, but may be available at a subordinate formation.\\n\\n3.62\\n\\nKeeping in view the varied levels of computerization of records and documents in\\n\\npublic authorities, data about records that have been digitized may be proactively disclosed\\n\\non the respective websites, excluding those records /files /informatiori that are exempted\\n\\nunder Section 8. The data about digitized record may include the name of the record and any\\n\\ncategorization or indexing used; the subject matter and any other information that is required\\n\\nto be compiled in relation to a file as prescribed by Manual of Office Procedure (and to be\\n\\nprescribed by MOP for electronic records that is under finalization by DARPG), the division!\\n\\nsection! unit/ office where the record is normally held; the person, with designation,\\n\\nresponsible for maintaining the record; and the life span of the record, as prescribed in the\\n\\nrelevant record retention schedule.\\n\\n145/191\\n\\n11/13/ 202 i -IR-I\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-!\\n\\n4.0\\n\\nComplia 11CC w itli 1\\'l\\'ONiUliS of vim i/win (pr0a:ti\\\\ ej disclosure under the RTI Act\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nEach M in istrv/Publ ic Authorit\\n\\nshall eusare that these guidelines are t\\'ul lv\\n\\noperational ized with in a period of\\' 6 months from the dat 0! their iSSLIC.\\n\\n4.2\\n\\nProactive disclosure as per these guide! nes v on Id require cot lating a large quantLim\\n\\nof in formation and dicitizing h.

An ACR contains information about the character, capability and other attributes of the official reported upon, disclosure of which to any other person amounts to cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. Besides, an ACR, as its name suggests, is a confidential document. The Official Secrets Act, 1923 is not completely superseded by the Right to Information Act..

However, the public authority has a discretion to disclose the Annual Confidential Reports of an employee to the employee himself or to any other person, if the public authority is satisfied that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.

References have been received in this Department seeking clarification whether the above provision of the Act requires all the records to be preserved for more than a period of 20 years. The Second Administrative Reforms Commission, in its First Report titled the \\'Right To Information — Master Key to Good Governance\\', has also expressed an apprehension about interpretation of the above provision with reference to the retention schedule of the files.\\n\\n2. The RYI Act does not prescribe a record retention schedule. The records are to be retained by a public authority as per the record retention schedule applicable to that public authority. It is, however, important to note that weeding out of a file or any other record does not necessarily result into desmiction of all the information contained in that file or record. It is possible that information generated in a file may be available in the form of\\' an OM or a letter or in any other form even after the file has been weeded out. The above referred provision of the Act requires furnishing of information so available after the lapse of 20 years even if such information was exempt from disclosure under sub-section (1) of Section 8. It means that the information which, in normal course, is exempt from disclosure under sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Act, would cease to be exempted if 20 years have lapsed after occurrence of the incident to which the information relates. However, the following types of information would continue to be exempt and there would be no obligation, even after lapse of 20 years, to give any citizen - Information disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interest of the State, relation with foreign slate or lead to incitement of an offence;\\n\\n157/191\\n\\n252?461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n\\nNo. 1/20/2009-IR Government of India Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions Department of Personnel & Training\\n\\nNorth Block, New Delhi Dated: the 73rd June, 2009\\n\\nOFFICE MEMORANDUM\\n\\nSubject: Disclosure of \\'file noting\\' under the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\nThe undersigned is directed to say that various MinisfriesiDepartments etc. have been seeking clarification about disclosure of file noting under the Right to Information Act, 2005.

The Appellate Authority was very right in deciding that this\\n\\nentire class of information was qualified as personal informahon witIn the\\n\\nmeaning of the provisions of Section 8 (i) (j) of the All Act. In this connection, it\\n\\nis very pertinent to cite the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the\\'SLP(C)\\n\\nNo. 27734 of 2012 (Girish P Deshpando vs dO and others) in which it has held\\n\\nthat the performance of an employee/Officer in an organisation is primarily a\\n\\nmatter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects\\n\\nare governed by tho service rules which fall under the expression personal\\n\\ninformation, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or\\n\\npublic interest.

He apprehends, the\\n\\ninterested parties would cause a threat to the activist and\\n\\nin fact there had been past incidents of unnatural deaths\\n\\nof activist in the field, presumably by the interested\\n\\npersons having vested interest to conceal the information\\n\\nthat is asked for by the activist.\\n\\nThe petitioner submits, the authority may not\\n\\ninsist upon the detailed address particularly when the\\n\\napplicant would provide a particular post box number\\n\\nthat would automatically conceal their identity to the\\n\\npublic at large.\\n\\nWe have considered the relevant provisions of\\n\\nthe statute. Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act,\\n\\n2005 would clearly provide, an applicant making request\\n\\nfor information shall not be required to give any reason\\n\\nfor requesting the information or any other personal\\n\\ndetails except those that may be necessary for\\n\\ncontacting him.\\n\\nLooking to the said provision, we find logic in\\n\\nthe submission of the petitioner. When the legislature\\n\\nthought it fit, the applicant need not disclose any\\n\\npersonal detail, the authority should not insist upon his\\n\\n167/191\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n11/13/ 202 i -IR-\\n\\n2\\n\\ndetailed whereabouts particularly when post box number\\n\\nis provided for that would establish contact with him and\\n\\nthe authority.\\n\\nIn case, the authority would find any difficulty\\n\\nwith the post box number, they may insist upon personal\\n\\ndetails. However, in such case, it would be the solemn\\n\\nduty of the authority to hide such information and\\n\\nparticularly from their website so that people at large\\n\\nwould not know of the details.\\n\\nWe thus dispose of this writ petition by making\\n\\nthe observations as above. The Secretary, Ministry of\\n\\nPersonnel should circulate the copy of this order to all\\n\\nconcerned so that the authority can take appropriate\\n\\nmeasure to hide information with regard to personal\\n\\ndetails of the activist to avoid any harassment by the\\n\\npersons having vested interest.\\n\\nThe writ petition is disposed of without any\\n\\norder as to costs.\\n\\nUrgent certified copy of this order, if applied for,\\n\\nbe given to the parties, on priority basis.\\n\\n(Barterjee, Acting Chief Justice)\\n\\n(Debangsu Basak, J.)\\n\\n168/19 1\\n\\n2522461/2023/JR-I\\n\\n11//i 3/2021-IR-I\\n\\nF.No. 1/1/2013-JR Government of India Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Department of Personnel and Training\\n\\nNorth Block, New Delhi Dated the 7th October, 2016\\n\\nOFFiCE MEMORANDUM\\n\\nSubject- Uploading of RTI replies on the respective websites of\\n\\nMinistries I Deparbnents\\n\\nAttention is invited to para 1.41. of the enclosed guidelines referred to in this Deptt.\\'s O.M.

Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors.\\n\\nThe undersigned is directed to invite attention to this Department\\'s O.M. No.1/4/2009-IR dated 05.10.2009 whereby a Guide on the Right to Information Act, 2005 was circulated. Para 10 of Part I of the Guide, inter alia, stated that \\'only such information can be supplied under the Act which already exists and is held by the public authority or held under the control of the public authority. The Public Information Officer is not supposed to create information; or to interpret information; or to solve the problems raised by the applicants, or to furnish replies to hypothetical questions.\\' The same issue has been elaborated by the Supreme Court in the matter of Central Board of Secondary Education & Anr. Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.6454 of 2011) as follows:\\n\\n\"At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about the RTI Act. The Rh Act provldes access to all information that is available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the definitions of \\'information\\' and \\'right to information\\' under clauses (f) and (j) of section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may access such informatiofi, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide \\'advice\\' or \\'opinion\\' to an applicant, nor required to obtain and\\n\\n180/19 1\\n\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n\\nfurnish any \\'opinion\\' or adiice\\' to an ipoiicant. The reference to \\'opinion\\' or \\'advice\\' in the definition of \\'information\\' in section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public a ithor.ity. Many public authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act.\"\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThis may be brought to the notice of all concerned.\\n\\n(K.G.

This access in the form of the right to information is an essential aspect of a civil and democratic society. The existence of legislation around freedom or right to information has a direct impact on the approach of government functionaries and potentially prevents abuse of processes by the state.\\n\\nFreedom of information, broadly articulated as right to information in India was enshrined in the Universal Declaration for Human Rights as far back as 1948 where it was included as one of the instruments also recognized this facets of freedom of expression. Subsequent particular right. After years of movement seeking legislation on right to information, the Indian government enacted the Right to Information Act in 2005.\\n\\ninternational\\n\\nThe Right to Information Act was enacted with the objective of “setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority.”\\n\\nDespite the novel intentions of the legislature, the implementation of the act has not been smooth at all. The Public Information Officers (PIOs) and the Appellate Authorities (AAs) established under the act deny information arbitrarily without any legal basis under the RTI Act. While lawyers might somehow be able to crack the flawed replies with complex legal arguments, the task is not as easy for people without a legal background. Therefore, it is necessary that legal information on tackling the illegalities of the PIOs and the AAs is accessed by a wider audience.\\n\\nThe current toolkit was born out of the experience of a multitude of people in civil society dealing with arbitrary and illegal actions of the PIOs and the AAs. The toolkit is simple and easy to understand, and it is recommended that you read the section on how to use this toolkit to better understand the complex legal arguments that go in dismantling the replies of the PIOs.\\n\\n3 | Page\\n\\nHow to use this Toolkit\\n\\nThe current toolkit follows a simple format of a problem-solution approach. It is made from the collective experience of a bunch of people who have been using RTIs as a main tool for research.\\n\\nPart I – It firstly delineates important definitions in the Act and their interpretations by various courts. It will be preferable if the reader goes through them.\\n\\nPart II – After the definitions, it is necessary to go through the format of application and appeal. Although there is no hard and fast rule as to how an application is to be filed, the format presents some critical elements which may help in appeal.\\n\\nPart III – We then deal with tackling the replies of the PIOs by covering responses against the most common grounds of rejection in our experience. We deal with the rejection of the RTI application on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act and arguments and cases to tackle them during appeal. Further, we have also dealt with judgments that are usually misinterpreted and used as the basis of rejection of applications.\\n\\nPart IV – In this part, we have covered the grounds of rejection under respective RTI state rules of Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Jharkhand and our arguments against the same.\\n\\n4 | Page\\n\\nI.\\n\\nGeneral Provisions\\n\\nA. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS UNDER THE RTI ACT (WITH CASE LAWS)\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nSection 2(f) “information”\\n\\nSection 2(f) “information”: \"information\" means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force.\\n\\nImportant case: Ahmed v. CPIO, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, 2018 SCC OnLine CIC 312\\n\\nSection 2(i) record\\n\\nSection 2(i) record: \"record\" includes— (a) any document, manuscript and file; (b) any microfilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document; (c) any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarged or not); and (d) any other material produced by a computer or any other device;\\n\\nSection 2(j) “right to information”\\n\\nSection 2(j) “right to information”: \"right to information\" means the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to— (i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device;\\n\\nB. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE UNDER SECTION 4\\n\\nSection 4 requires every public authority (definition of term ‘public authority’ is given under Section 2(h)) to provide all the information that is mentioned in Section 4(1)(b) to the public suo moto (that is, without any request by any individual) through various means of communication at regular intervals.\\n\\nSection 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act lists information that the public authorities have to publish by themselves. This list contains within its ambit a vast array of information. The use of the word “shall” in the provision makes it mandatory and binding on the part of the public authorities to disclose this information on their website or make it easily accessible. This needs to be done in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority and to contain corruption.\\n\\n5 | Page\\n\\nThis is the greatest weapon while filing an RTI application and an appeal as well. The grounds of rejection reduce drastically if the information sought explicitly covers information to be proactively disclosed under this section. In any instance when information is denied by the public authority, we also try to show how the information has to be disclosed under S. 4.\\n\\nFor example - refer.\\n\\nC. IMPORTANCE OF SECTION 6\\n\\nSection 6(2): An applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him.\\n\\nSection 6(3) deals with transfer of RTIs and places the obligation to transfer RTIs on the public authority themselves to the relevant department/authority.\\n\\nWhere an application is made to a public authority requesting for an information— (i) which is held by another public authority; or (ii) the subject matter of which is more closely connected with the functions of another public authority, the public authority, to which such application is made, shall transfer the application or such part of it as may be appropriate to that other public authority and inform the applicant immediately about such transfer\\n\\nD. SEVERABILITY UNDER SECTION 10\\n\\nIf information is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to information which is exempt from disclosure, then as per Section 10, access can still be provided to specific parts of the entire set of information which does not contain that information which is exempt from disclosure. The PIO needs to let the applicant know of this decision along with reasons, fees, etc.\\n\\nE. CASE LAW ON IMPORTANCE OF BEING HEARD DURING APPEAL\\n\\nWe further submit that taking a decision in the First Appeal without hearing the Applicant is a violation of the principles of natural justice and the spirit of the RTI Act.\\n\\nIn the matter of Mr. R. K. Jain vs. Department of Legal Affairs Government of India (File No.CIC/SA/A/2014/000254) the Central Information Commission observed the following: “Passing orders in first appeal without hearing or sending hearing notice is illegal and will render the order invalid. The Commission has set aside the order of First Appellate Authority for breach of natural justice by denying the appellant a chance of presenting his case and by raising an entirely a new defence which was never claimed. The Commission recommended to initiate disciplinary action against the officer who was First Appellate Authority though he retired from service.”\\n\\n6 | Page\\n\\nII.\\n\\nFormat of RTI Applications and Appeals\\n\\nA.

Usually, as has been stated above, the replies of the PIO while rejecting the application are based on incorrect interpretation of law and cases decided by the CIC or the Supreme Court. This is also a scare tactic utilized by them as language of the law can be daunting for people who are not accustomed to it.\\n\\nSince most of the replies by the PIO are bad in law, challenging these replies is not very difficult. Appellants can refer to the RTI Act, various judgments, the lacunae in the judgments cited by the PIO, the base documents of the relevant subject matter and draft a comprehensive reply for the same. The appeal application has to be strong in law as the appellate authorities, like the PIOs, are looking for any reason to reject your appeal. Usually, the only thing that causes fear in them is the language of the law realizing that they cannot misinterpret law and randomly cite inapplicable provisions and cases because the appellant knows how to counter each and every argument put forth.\\n\\nIn this part, we have tried to cover and tackle as many grounds of rejection as possible. We have further divided this part into two sections. The first section deals with the rejection of the RTI application on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act or respective RTI state rules, and arguments and cases to tackle them during appeal. The second section deals with judgments that are usually misinterpreted and used as the basis of rejection of applications.\\n\\nA. REJECTION OF APPLICATIONS ON FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL PROVISIONS\\n\\n1. SECTION 7(9)\\n\\nSection 7(9): An information shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is sought unless it would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the record in question.\\n\\nThis section is often erroneously cited by the PIO to reject the application on the grounds that information is not kept in the format as requested by the applicant. It is also used to state that the information sought is voluminous and divert the resources of the public authority.\\n\\nThe denial of information on the basis of Section 7 (9) of the Act does not have any basis in law. Denial of information can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9. Section 7(9) can be invoked only to state that information in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible. According to the section, if the PIO thinks that substantial resources will be diverted if the information is provided in the format sought, the PIO is bound to provide information in the format that is present with them.\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO:\\n\\nReason stated for denying information is diversion of resources.\\n\\nMrs. Shema vs Aligarh Muslim (2009) (CIC/OK/A/2008/01256/SG/0937) is strongly relied on. The relevant portion is produced below: -\\n\\n“The denial of information on the basis of Section 11 and Section 7 (9) of the Act was without\\n\\n10 | Page\\n\\nany basis in law. Denial of information can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9.”\\n\\nSection 7 (9) can be invoked only to state that information in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible. However, the PIO would have to offer the information in an alternate format when invoking Section 7 (9).\\n\\nFor information being voluminous\\n\\nMs. Bincy Thomas v. East Coast Railway, Waltair (2010) (CIC/OP/A/2009/000204-AD)\\n\\n“As for information having been denied since it is voluminous, the Commission holds that Section 7(9) of the Act does not allow denial of information but denial of providing the same in the form in which it has been sought in the event this leads to disproportionate diversion of resources of the Public Authority.”\\n\\n2. SECTION 8(1)(d)\\n\\nSection 8(1)(d) information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\nThe arguments will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. Usually, information which relate closely to trade secrets or might reveal details of the intellectual property right held are rejected at the outset.\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\nNo such information has been sought by the applicant which reveals the trade secrets of the intellectual property of the applicant. It does not endanger commercial interests of the third party either. Furthermore, it is in the interest of the larger public that the information sought is revealed as it relates to transparency and accountability of the government.\\n\\nThe appellant will then specifically need to argue pointwise as to how the information sought does not harm the competitive position of a third party - does not concern commercial confidence, IPR and trade secrets.\\n\\nCases to be cited: Facts and Applicability\\n\\n1)\\n\\nIf the information sought is regarding a contract or agreement entered into by the state with companies, and such information has been rejected on the ground of section 8(1)(d), then the following case can be cited.\\n\\nGita Dewan Verma v. Additional Secretary (UD) Govt. of NCT Delhi /WB/A/2007/00830/SG/ 1286)\\n\\n(2007)\\n\\n“Any agreement entered into by the Government is an agreement deemed to have been entered into on behalf of the and in the interest of \"We the people\" hence if any citizen wants to know the contents of such an agreement, he is in the position of a principal asking his agent to disclose to him the terms of the agreement entered into by the agent on behalf of the principal. No agent can refuse to disclose any such information to his principal. Hence it is inconceivable that the Government should deny a citizen\\'s request for disclosure of an agreement entered into by the Government. Such a denial goes against the established constitutional principles apart from being untenable under the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005.”\\n\\n2)\\n\\nIf the PIO claims that the information relates to the commercial confidence of a third party or trade secrets.\\n\\n11 | Page\\n\\n(CIC\\n\\nShonkh Technlogies v Maharashtra State Information Commission (2011 (113) BOMLR 2433.)\\n\\n“The information sought is in relation to the decision taken and the policy framed for providing the Smart Cards and if the means to provide the same are by inducting private service providers, then, only details of the agreements executed with such service providers and the copies thereof have been sought. In my view, there was nothing in the information sought by the Respondent No.4, by which commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property is being disclosed, leave alone the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party or it would lead to incitement of an offence. Merely because the details of the service providers are to be disclosed and the copies of the agreements would be provided, that does not mean that their interests are harmed or their competitive position is affected.”\\n\\n3. SECTION 8(1)(e)\\n\\nSection 8(1)(e): Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.\\n\\nThis provision provides for exemption of information from being disclosed as the information is available to a person in his fiduciary relationship. In such cases, information can be disclosed only if the authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information. The information is usually rejected on the grounds that the information sought for by the applicant is available to the concerned authority in fiduciary relationship.\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\n1)\\n\\nIf the PIO has denied access to information by stating that the information is held in fiduciary relationship, then showing what constitutes a fiduciary relationship can be an effective counter argument (we specifically applied this in the EPFO RTIs)\\n\\nIn decisions such as Mr. K K Bora vs Employees Provident Fund (Decision No. CIC/SG/A/2010/002600/12400), it has been clarified and upheld that for information to be exempted under S. 8(1)(e) “….it is necessary that the third party should have some choice in supplying the information and should have provided it with the condition of confidentiality.” As was further held in the case, the information held by EPFO is in discharge of a statutory requirement.\\n\\n“An equally important characteristic for the relationship to qualify as a fiduciary relationship is that the provider of information gives the information for using it for the benefit of the one who is providing the information. All relationships usually have an element of trust, but all of them cannot be classified as fiduciary. Information provided in discharge of a statutory requirement, or to obtain a job, or to get a license, cannot be considered to have been given in a fiduciary relationship.”\\n\\nIn a recent 2018 decision in the case Nagraj Janardhan Patil v. PIO, EPFO, Nasik (CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053 - 20 February 2018), the Commission went onto impose penalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO information on the grounds of it being “personal information’’ and “third party information’’ is “illegal and illogical”. While PIO argued that the information is personal and hence exempted, the CIC Acharyulu observed that Public Provident Fund is public information and should be given under RTI.\\n\\n12 | Page\\n\\nFurther, in another recent judgment in 2017 titled Shankar Singh v. PIO, EPFO, Jabalpur (CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the phrase “fiduciary relationship” was analysed in great detail by the Hon’ble Commission and finally it concluded that presence of a statutory duty to provide information that has to be distinguished from the fiduciary relation. The Order cited the Gujarat High Court judgment in Rajendra Vasantlal Shah vs. Central Information Commissioner and Ors (AIR 2011 Guj 70) which had held that any statutory body serving public good cannot claim to be working in a fiduciary capacity.\\n\\n2) General argument in all situations\\n\\nThe strongest argument against rejection under this provision can be made by citing section 4(1)(b) which is proactive disclosure. If the information sought comes under any of the clauses mentioned in the section, the argument of fiduciary relationship cannot stand.\\n\\nFor example, if information regarding budget disclosure of a particular department is rejected with the reason that it is against public interest, the applicant can sight section 4(1)(b)(xi) which states that, the authority is bound to publish “the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on disbursements made”.\\n\\nRakesh Kumar Singh and others versus Harish Chander, Assistant Director and others Central Information Commission (CIC/WB/A/2006/00469) held that-\\n\\n“The word fiduciary is derived from the Latin fiducia meaning “trust, a person (including a juristic person such as Government, University or bank) who has the power and obligation to act for another under circumstances which require total trust, good faith and honesty. The most common example of such a relationship is the trustee of a trust, but fiduciaries can include business advisers, attorneys, guardians, administrators, directors of a company, public servants in relation to a government and senior managers of a firm/company etc. The fiduciary relationship can also be one of moral or personal responsibility due to the superior knowledge and training of the fiduciary as compared to the one whose affairs the fiduciary is handling. In short, it is a relationship wherein one person places complete confidence in another in regard to a particular transaction or one’s general affairs of business.”\\n\\nIt is only if the relationship is of the nature as described above can the information be declined under section 8(1(e). If the relationship does not fulfil the above criteria, then section 8(1)(e) cannot be invoked.\\n\\nIn the case of Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry (Civil Appeal No. 91 of 2015), the CIC held that,\\n\\n“The exemption contained in Section 8(1)(e) applies to exceptional cases and only with regard to certain pieces of information, for which disclosure is unwarranted or undesirable. If information is available with a regulatory agency not in fiduciary relationship, there is no reason to withhold the disclosure of the same. However, where information is required by mandate of law to be provided to an authority, it cannot be said that such information is being provided in a fiduciary relationship.”\\n\\n4. SECTION 8(1)(h)\\n\\nSection 8(1)(h) (h): information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\n13 | Page\\n\\nIn the case Jiwan Garg vs. PIO, Director General of Police, Punjab, it was held that a vague or general plea that disclosure would impede the prosecution would not be sufficient.\\n\\n“Whether in a particular case disclosure of daily diary would impede investigation or prosecution of offenders is a matter of fact, to be judged on merits of each case. No generalized precedent applicable to all requests for information can be laid. Each case is to be judged on its facts and merits.\\n\\nSection 8 (1) (h) does not grant an automatic exemption from disclosure of information in each case which is at any stage of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. . . The respondent cannot presume an automatic connection between disclosure and impeding of investigation or prosecution etc of offenders. The respondent must show, at least prima facie, how disclosure of daily diary in fact would result in this consequence. The cause and affect need to be shown by respondent.\\n\\nDelhi High Court in W (PC) No. 3144 of 2007, while considering the import of Clause 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act held that, “It is apparent that the mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a ground for refusal of the information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory reasons as to why the release of such information would hamper the investigation process. Such reasons should be germane, and the opinion of the process being hampered should be reasonable and based on some material. Sans this consideration, Section 8 (1) (h) and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demand for information.”\\n\\n5. SECTION 8(1)(j)\\n\\nSection 8(1)(j): Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\\n\\nProvided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\\n\\nUsually, this section is cited when information regarding a third party is sought. Bear in mind that this section only emphasizes that “personal information” having no relationship with a public activity cannot be sought.\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\n1) The test under this provision\\n\\nApplications seeking ‘personal information’ cannot be rejected outrightly. For the exemption in section 8(1)(j) to apply, three conditions must be met:\\n\\n1. The information must be personal third-party information\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIt must have no relationship to any public activity or interest, and\\n\\n14 | Page\\n\\n3. Disclosure of the information must cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a third party.\\n\\nThe appellant can then explain the current fact scenario and how the information sought does not fulfil the ingredients of this section.\\n\\nFurthermore, according to section 11, if the part of the information does involve some personal information which might violate privacy of an individual, the same can be severed under section 10 of the Act, and the rest has to be provided.\\n\\nCases to be cited: Facts and Applicability\\n\\nConditions as laid out in Union Public Service Commission v R.K. Jain (decided on 6 November, 2012)\\n\\n“(i) The information sought must relate to \"Personal Information\". Therefore, if the information sought does not qualify as personal information, the exemption would not apply;\\n\\n(ii) Such personal information should relate to a third person, i.e., a person other than the information seeker or the public authority; AND\\n\\n(iii) (a) The information sought should not have a relation to any public activity qua such third person, or to public interest. If the information sought relates to public activity of the third party, i.e., to his activities falling within the public domain, the exemption would not apply. Similarly, if the disclosure of the personal information is found justified in public interest, the exemption would be lifted, otherwise not; OR (b) The disclosure of the information would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual, and that there is no larger public interest involved in such disclosure.”\\n\\nConditions (CIC/SM/A/2011/000318/SG/13429)\\n\\nas\\n\\nlaid out\\n\\nin Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs CBI\\n\\n1. It must be personal information: Words in a law should normally be given the meaning given in common language. In common language, we would ascribe the adjective \\'personal\\' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an institution or a Corporate. Therefore, it flows that \\'personal\\' cannot be related to institutions, organizations or corporates. Hence Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organizations or corporates.\\n\\n2. The phrase \\'disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest\\' means that the information must have been given in the course of a public activity. Various public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for \\'personal\\' information from citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. Public activities would typically include situations wherein a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, license or authorization, or provides information in discharge of a statutory obligation.\\n\\n3. The disclosure of the information would lead to unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a citizen. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply usually with certain safeguards. Therefore, where the State routinely obtains information from citizens, this information is\\n\\n15 | Page\\n\\n(2011)\\n\\nin relation to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy.\\n\\n2) Public bodies such as EPFO cannot claim this exemption (we specifically applied this in the EPFO RTIs)\\n\\nIn the case of Nagraj Janardhan Patil v. PIO, EPFO, Nasik (CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053 - 20 February 2018), the Commission went onto impose penalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO information on the grounds of it being “personal information’’ and “third party information’’ is “illegal and illogical”. While PIO argued that the information is personal and hence exempted, the CIC Acharyulu observed that “Public Provident Fund is public information and should be given under RTI, to anyone who seeks it, even if it is of another person”.\\n\\nin Shankar Singh v. PIO, EPFO, Jabalpur (CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the Further, Central Information Commissioner Prof. M. Sridhar Acharyuluha further ordered that information regarding the Provident Fund is “neither third party information nor anybody’s personal information. It does not warrant invocation of section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act.”\\n\\n6. SECTION 11: THIRD PARTY INFORMATION\\n\\nUsually, this section is cited by the PIO when the information sought is about a third party. This entire process of serving notice to the third person is rarely followed. Despite the section clearly stipulating the procedure, the PIOs tend to outrightly rejected the application under section 11 read with section 8 (1)(j)\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\nIn such cases, PIO is required to follow the procedure laid down in Section 11 of the RTI Act (that is, give the third-party time and opportunity to raise objections if he/she has any and consider the same before taking any decision). The final decision with regards to disclosure lies with the Public Information Officer and not the third party.\\n\\nIt has been provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure has to be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs any possible harm or injury to the interests of a third party. If the third party is aggrieved by the decision arrived at by the PIO, it can prefer an appeal against the decision under Section 19.\\n\\nFurthermore, it can also be shown that the information relates to a larger public interest and hence, it is needed to be disclosed.\\n\\nCases to be cited\\n\\nMrs. Anita Singh Vs. Ministry of External Affairs (2012) (CIC/SG/A/2012/000879/18681):\\n\\n“Section 11 does not give a third party an unrestrained veto to refuse disclosing information. It clearly anticipates situations where the PIO will not agree with the claim for non-disclosure by a third party and provides for an appeal to be made by the third party against disclosure, which would have been unnecessary, if the third party had been given a veto against disclosure. Thus, the PIO is expected to follow the procedure of Section 11, when he intends to disclose the information but has some reason to believe that the third party treats it as confidential. If the third party sends an objection, the PIO has to determine whether the information is exempt under the provisions of the Act.”\\n\\n16 | Page\\n\\nMahesh Kumar Sharma, Vs. PIO, Delhi Jal Board, Govt. of NCT of Delhi (2009) (CIC /AT/A/2008/01262//SG/adj):\\n\\n“If the third-party objects to giving the information, the Public Information Officer must take his objections and see if any of the exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) apply. If any of the exemption clauses apply, the PIO is then obliged to see if there is a larger public interest in disclosure. If none of the exemption clauses apply, information has to be given.”\\n\\nB. WHEN PIO REJECTS INFORMATION THROUGH FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF LANDMARK\\n\\nJUDGMENTS\\n\\nIn this part, we will now discuss the counter to a few specific cases that the PIOs often use to reject information.\\n\\n1. CBSE VS. ADITYA BANDOPADHYAY [CIVIL APPEAL NO.6454 OF 2011 (SUPREME COURT)]\\n\\n“But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non-available information and then furnish it to an applicant.”\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO:\\n\\nThe judgments cited by the PIO such as CBSE vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay would be applicable only if there is no obligation to collect, collate or create any such information. Relevant portion of this case states that “If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analyzed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may access such information, subject to the exemptions in section 8 of the Act.”\\n\\nThe judgment does not apply in the present case as the public authority concerned was under an obligation to maintain the information the applicant is seeking. Firstly, the information sought is covered by section 4(1)(b) and by virtue of section 4(2) of the RTI Act the authority is duty bound to disclose it. Furthermore, section 7(9) clearly stipulates that the information shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is with the authority if the authority finds it is difficult or impossible to collect or collate data in the format that it has been sought in.\\n\\nFor example, in one particular case, Public Information Officer of a District Legal Services Authority cited this judgment to deny information that it was required to maintain as per ‘National Legal Services Authority’s Standard Operating Procedure for Under Trial Review Committees’ (find appeal petition attached here)\\n\\n2. CBSE VS. ADITYA BANDOPADHYAY [CIVIL APPEAL NO.6454 OF 2011 (SUPREME COURT)]\\n\\n“A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide “advice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any “opinion or “advice” to an applicant.”\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\n17 | Page\\n\\nThe definition of the word ‘information’ is given in Section 2(f) of the Act and it does include opinion and advice. The PIO has selectively quoted the paragraph from the judgment. The entire quote is, “A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide “advice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any “opinion or “advice” to an applicant. The reference to ‘opinion’ or ‘advice’ in the definition of ‘information’ in section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public authority.” Therefore, it is clear that advice and opinion, if available in the records of the public authority, is information and the PIO is statutorily bound to supply such information.\\n\\nMoreover, A perusal of the application will convince the Appellate Authority that the applicant is not seeking opinion or advice from the authority concerned but information that it was under an obligation to maintain under either Section 4 or as per guidelines issued by a particular authority (here you can cite the base document or the sub-clause under section 4(1)(b) that is applicable or both.).\\n\\n3. VIDYADHAR MISHRA V. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH [WPC NO. 997 OF 2019 (CHHATTISGARH HC)]\\n\\n“The information which was sought for by the petitioner was in nature of questionnaire meaning thereby in order to provide the information, the office of Sub-Registrar was required to make a search on behalf of the petitioner and thereafter take out the information and then supply it to petitioner.”\\n\\nArguments against the reply of the PIO\\n\\nThe applicant would like to humbly submit that the judgment stated in the RTI response does not apply in the present case as the information sought by the applicant is not in the nature of questionnaire but data that the concerned authority was either required to proactively disclose under Section 4 of the Act or was under a mandate to maintain as per the guidelines issued by a particular authority.\\n\\nIn the particular case cited by the PIO, the petitioner wanted the officers to make an enquiry and figure out how many parts of a land measuring 2.02 acres were sold and to whom in between the period of 1935-1943 and provide him with the certified copies of recovered sale deeds.\\n\\nThe current application does not purport the PIO to go to such lengths at all. Furthermore, the judgment is very specific to the particular case and does not hold any value in terms of principle established.\\n\\n4. VINUBHAI HARIBHAI PATEL VS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX [R/LPA NO. 1169/2016 (GUJARAT HC)]\\n\\n“In order to check the abuse and misuse of the purpose and procedure enacted in the RTI Act, it is very essential to keep out the applicants and persons who approach the Authorities concerned except for bona fide reasons. The existence of bona fide reasons is a question of fact, which has to be established by the Applicant with relevant material and not just empty and hollow words to be used. In the background of the case which we have in hand, we see only the private interest of the Applicant petitioner and not even a semblance of public interest in the same.”\\n\\n18 | Page\\n\\nArgument against reply of the PIO\\n\\nIt is clearly stated in Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act that ‘an applicant making a request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information’. Moreover, as per Section 7(1), a request can be rejected only for any of the reasons specified in Section 8 and 9. ‘Public Interest’ is not one of the reasons specified therein and “the Act gives no scope to the adjudicating authorities to import new exceptions other than those that have been provided under the Act and thereby deny information.”\\n\\nMoreover, the judgement of Gujarat High Court in Vinubhai Patel’s case cannot be relied on because in that particular case, the petitioner had requested for access to Income Tax Returns to settle a private dispute between the petitioner and the third party in question. Disclosure of information by the concerned authorities would not have served any public interest and also caused an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\\n\\n5. A. KANAGARAJ VS THE PRINCIPAL COMMISSIONER [WP(MD) NO. 2268 OF 2010 (MADRAS HC)]\\n\\n“The object of the Right to Information Act is salutary and the same serves the avowed object of transparency in public offices. At the same time, the said Act should not be allowed to be abused or misused by any unscrupulous parties. For example, suppose an information relating to several decades, running to several pages, is sought for, the Public Information Officer may have to depute several persons to collect those particulars and then to count the pages and calculate the fee to be paid by the party concerned. All these exercises should be done at the cost of Rs. 10/- paid by the applicant. After that, the applicant should be informed by the Public Information Officer to pay the required amount. For example, suppose the Public Information Officer directs the applicant to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-, the applicant may not pay the amount, in which case the entire exercise done in collecting the information, running to several pages, relating to several decades, would be a wasteful exercise. Assuming that the applicant is prepared to pay the money thereafter, the entire office machinery should be focused only in preparing the copies of the documents and furnishing the same to the applicant, leaving behind the regular work of the office. By only taking all these into account, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court has held that if the request is made in respect of indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the Right to Information Act for disclosure of all and transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and sundry information unrelated to eradication of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused!\"\\n\\ncorruption,\\n\\nit would be counterproductive and it will adversely affect the efficiency of\\n\\nEffective Response\\n\\nThe denial of information on the basis of Section 7 (9) of the Act does not have any basis in law. Denial of information can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9. Section 7(9) can be invoked only to state that information in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible. However, the PIO would have to offer the information in an alternate format when invoking Section 7 (9) of the Act.\\n\\nMoreover, the decision of the Madras High Court in Kanagaraj’s case cannot be relied upon to deny information that is focused, time-bound and has a direct nexus with the transparent functioning of a public authority because in that particular case, the information sought was vast,\\n\\n19 | Page\\n\\nrelating to several decades and historical records and had no immediate implications for the functioning of any public authority. The petitioner had sought “records pertaining to the Estates in the entire Theni and Dindigul Districts, relating to the pre-independence period as well as post-independence period. the petitioner has asked for information relating to the registers Without specifying the particular record, maintained under the Estates Land Act, 1908 and and Estate Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari Act, 1948, Pimash Registers, names and other details of the Estate holders and some more details”.\\n\\nIn the current application, such extravagant data has not been sought and only information that pertains to the official functioning of the authority which they are statutorily bound to maintain has been sought.\\n\\n6. REGISTRAR GENERAL VS. K. ELANGO AND ANR (W.P.NO.20485 OF 2012) (DIVISION BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT)\\n\\n“Therefore, some self-restrictions are to be imposed in regard to the supply of information in this regard. As a matter of the Notings, Jottings, Administrative Letters, Intricate Internal Discussions, Deliberations etc. of the Petitioner/High Court cannot be brought under Section 2(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005,\\n\\nfact,\\n\\nParagraph 61… If the information sought for is divulged for, furnished by the Office of the High Court (on administrative side), internal working process may get jeopardized.”\\n\\nThis case is notoriously misused often by PIOs to brush off information requests in the guise of “internal matter” or “internal functioning” or something along these lines.\\n\\nThis case is often used to say that is “purely internal correspondence”, that it would jeopardize the workings of the public authority, that it cannot be considered as \"information\" under Sec. 2(j) of the RTI Act and that it cannot be provided.\\n\\nthe information requested for\\n\\nArgument against the reply of the PIO\\n\\nThe current judgment is about information sought regarding the investigation and inquiries against high court judges that had the potential of derailing investigations and judicial autonomy. Therefore, if internal correspondence is not governed by any statute and involves information that is to be proactively disclosed by the authority under section 4, the authority is bound to disclose such information.\\n\\nthis judgment\\n\\nis not applicable in the current case. Furthermore,\\n\\n20 | Page\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nState-specific RTI issues\\n\\n1. CHHATTISGARH\\n\\nb) Request must relate only to a single subject matter\\n\\nRule 3 of Chhattisgarh RTI Rules, 2009 and Rule 3A of Maharashtra RTI Rules along with multiple other State Rules\\n\\nRequest relate only to single subject matter: - A request in writing for information under Section 6 of the Act shall relate to one subject matter and it shall not ordinarily exceed one hundred and fifty words. If an application wishes to seek information on more than one subject matter, he shall make separate applications.\\n\\nProvided that in case, the request made relates to more than one subject matter, the Public Information Officer may respond to the request relating to the first subject matter only and may advise the applicant to make separate application for each of the other subject matters.\\n\\nThis reason is used most often by PIOs to reject the information when multiple information is sought even if they are regarding one subject matter.\\n\\nNowhere is it mentioned in Section 6 which deals with ‘Request for obtaining information’ that the application needs to be restricted to one subject matter and Section 7(1) of the Act clearly states that requests for information can only be rejected for any of the reasons specified in sections 8 and 9.\\n\\nIt is further stated that the provision stating information sought has to be regarding only one subject matter, does not mean one query is equal to one subject and multiple information regarding the same subject matter can be asked.\\n\\nThe provision states that questions regarding only one subject matter can be asked, and the applicant has made sure that the information is only regarding one subject matter. Again, the PIO did not take into consideration the fact that “multiple information can be asked regarding one subject matter so long as the application is ordinarily under 150 words.”\\n\\nIn Sh. Ram Prakash Choudhary v. Public Information Officer Ministry of Health & Family Welfare Health Department (CIC/SG/A/2011/002312/15906), the CIC stated that,\\n\\n“From a plain reading of Sections 6(1) and 7(1) of the RTI Act, there does not appear to be any embargo on the scope of such request or application. In other words, there is no legal requirement on an applicant’s part to restrict the scope of her RTI application to only one subject matter.\\n\\nWhat constitutes a ‘single subject matter’ has neither been defined in the RTI Act, the rules and regulations framed thereunder. In the absence of any means to determine what tantamounts to ‘one subject matter’, the PIO can, at his discretion, furnish part information claiming that the remaining information sought in the RTI application pertains to a different subject matter for which a separate RTI application is required to be filed. The exercise of such discretion by the PIO is likely to be subjective resulting in arbitrary curtailment of the fundamental right to information of citizens and unnecessary expenditure of money. In the absence of any clear definition of what ‘one category of request’ means it would only lead to arbitrary refusals of information under the RTI Act, leading to clogging of the appellate mechanisms. In view of the above, the contention of the Respondents is rejected.”\\n\\n21 | Page\\n\\nc) Total words in the application should not exceed 150 words\\n\\nUnder the Chhattisgarh state and Court RTI rules, request for information should not be more than 150 words.

Das, Senior Advocate present.\\n\\nFACTS:\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe appellant filed RTI application seeking scanned answer sheets of all\\n\\nsix subjects attempted by his son Kaushik Kumar Giri in the CISCE examinations\\n\\nfor 2014-15, along with information about whether money deposited for\\n\\nrechecking of answer sheets is refundable or not. The CPIO claimed that CISCE\\n\\nwas not ‘public authority’ under the RTI Act. FAA upheld the order of the CPIO.\\n\\nThe appellant approached the Commission.\\n\\nDecision :\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe Advocate representing the respondent authority stated that the\\n\\nrechecking sought was done and the new result was found to be the same as\\n\\nearlier and the same was communicated to the appellant. The appellant further\\n\\nwanted re-evaluation of her results. The CPIO said re-evaluation was not\\n\\nprovided under norms of Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and\\n\\nRs. 4000 was the fees prescribed for rechecking of all the papers, which was\\n\\nnon-refundable.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nRegarding the request for copies of answer sheets, Mr. Mohan Chandran,\\n\\nAssistant Secretary stated that they are not public authority and hence there are\\n\\nunder no obligation to share the information. He stated that two High Court\\n\\njudgments upheld their contention that CISCE was not a public authority.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe CISCE is a regulatory body of thousands of schools spread over\\n\\nvarious states and discharging regulatory duties similar to those of CBSE. The\\n\\nSupreme Court has delivered a landmark judgment in CBSE v Aditya\\n\\nBandopadhyay & Ors. [2011 (8) SCC 497] finally settling principle on sharing\\n\\nthe answer sheets of the candidates in the interest of protecting the standards of\\n\\neducation through transparency. The Commission fails to understand why CISCE\\n\\nwill not follow norms set by Supreme Court in CBSE v Aditya Bandopadhyay &\\n\\nOrs.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nAs per the landmark judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the\\n\\nevaluated answer-books of an examinee writing a public examination conducted\\n\\nby statutory bodies like CBSE or any University or Board of Secondary\\n\\nEducation, being a `document, manuscript record, and opinion\\' fell within the\\n\\ndefinition of \"information\" as defined in section 2(f) of the RTI Act. It held that\\n\\nthe provisions of the RTI Act should be interpreted in a manner which would lead\\n\\ntowards dissemination of information rather than withholding the same; and in\\n\\nview of the right to information, the examining bodies were bound to provide\\n\\ninspection of evaluated answer books to the examinees. Consequently it directed\\n\\nCBSE to grant inspection of the answer books to the examinees who sought\\n\\ninformation. As laid down by the Supreme Court:\\n\\n“The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced strictly and all efforts should\\n\\nbe made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of\\n\\nsection 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and\\n\\naccountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging\\n\\ncorruption... We, therefore, hold that an examining body does not hold the\\n\\nevaluated answer-books in a fiduciary relationship. Not being information\\n\\navailable to an examining body in its fiduciary relationship, the exemption\\n\\nunder section 8(1)(e) is not available to the examining bodies with reference\\n\\nto evaluated answer-books. As no other exemption under section 8 is\\n\\navailable in respect of evaluated answer books, the examining bodies will\\n\\nhave to permit inspection sought by the examinees.”\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe stand of the Council that they will only allow re-checking of marks\\n\\naccording to their policy and they will neither share nor re-evaluate is contrary\\n\\nto the transparency norms, Judgment of Supreme Court. While every University\\n\\nand Educational Institution provide for access, rechecking or recounting and re-\\n\\nevaluation of evaluated answersheets, denying them is inequality and not in\\n\\ntune with the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court and also contrary to principles\\n\\nof transparency and accountability as envisaged under RTI Act. It is not\\n\\nconvincing that without sharing evaluated answer-sheets how can they assure\\n\\njustice to the students, who at times might be helpless victims of unreasonable\\n\\nevaluation? Why not students get chance to question the defective or negligent\\n\\nevaluation of a particular answer sheet? It is not proper in the part of this\\n\\nprestigious Council to leave the students remedy-less in such situations of\\n\\ninjustice. The Council should provide space to students, review the examination\\n\\nsystem and also access to the answer sheet either by inspection or sharing a\\n\\ncopy. The issue is not whether they are public authority but, whether they\\n\\nshould be accountable or not?\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe CISCE being an examining body cannot perpetuate absolute secrecy\\n\\naround answer sheets when all the educational institutions of the entire nation\\n\\nare sharing the answer sheets with the students following Supreme Court order.\\n\\nThis Society has no right or authority over answer-sheets of students. The\\n\\nstudents cannot be denied of their copyright in the answer sheet. The examining\\n\\nbody like CISCE might have IPR right over question paper but they do not have\\n\\nany such right on the answer sheets of the students.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nThe Assistant Secretary who represented the Council submitted that they\\n\\ndon’t give answer sheets except only on the directions given by the court of law.\\n\\nThus the courts implemented Aditya Bandopadhyay judgment with reference to\\n\\nthis Council on application by some students. Does it mean that the Council will\\n\\ngive answer sheets only when students approached the court of law? It is not\\n\\nproper for the Council to drive their students to the courts which is both time\\n\\nconsuming and expensive to the students/parents and also to the Council. They\\n\\nmight have to pay fee to the lawyers and also incur legal expenses. The\\n\\nCommission hopes that the Council realises the need for transparency and adopt\\n\\nitself to the change in norms of examination regulations and bring in necessary\\n\\nchanges to promote transparency and accountability in examination as\\n\\nmandated by Hon’ble Supreme Court and Parliament through Right to\\n\\nInformation Act.\\n\\n10. As a registered society performing the regulatory functions in education\\n\\nand examinations, it has fiduciary responsibility to protect higher standards of\\n\\nexamination and evaluation which is possible only through transparency and\\n\\naccountability. They cannot hang on to their pre-independence colonial legacy of\\n\\nsecrecy of answer sheets anymore.\\n\\n11.\\n\\nThe Commission directs Mr. Mohan Chandran, Assistant Secretary of the\\n\\nCouncil to take this issue before their governing body so that they review their\\n\\npolicy and provide copies of answer sheets to the students as directed by the\\n\\nHon’ble Supreme Court and introduce re-evaluation also. The Commission also\\n\\nrecommends Registrar of Societies to take appropriate steps to bring in\\n\\ntransparency and accountability in the Council. The Commission directs the\\n\\nrespondent authority to provide certified copies of answer sheets as sought by\\n\\nthe appellant, within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order.\\n\\nSD\\n\\n(M.

Petitioner Vs. 1.K.Elango 2.The Registrar, The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, No.2, Sir Thyegaraya Salai, Teynampet, Chennai 600 018. .. Respondents (R2 impleaded as per order dated 04.10.2012 in M.P.2/2012)\\n\\nPRAYER: Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying for an issuance of a Writ of Certiorari calling for the records in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 of the Tamil Nadu Information Commission and quash the same. For Petitioner : Mr.S.Haja Mohideen Gisthi For 1st Respondent : Party in Person For 2nd Respondent : Mr.G.Rajagopalan, Senior Counsel For M/s.G.R. Associates ORDER M.VENUGOPAL,J. The Petitioner has preferred the instant Writ Petition as against the order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai. 2.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 has, among other things, observed that \\'A perusal of the appeal and the replies furnished by the public authority shows that the appellant has only asked for details relating to the number of subordinate Judges, employees, compliants of bribe and so on in the subordinate judiciary. He has not asked for details of anything which could be termed as Judicial proceedings or part of the Judicial process. During the enquiry it was also confirmed by the Assistant Public Information Officer that these details are received and collected by the Registry of the High Court routinely. Section 4 of the RTI Act very clearly defines the obligation of the public authorities. Most of the information sought for by the present appellant seem to be covered in this section. Such being the case the Hon\\'ble High Court,Madras, being a public authority, requires to provide access to these information unless expressly prohibited by a Competent forum or exempted as defined under various sections of the RTI Act. It is also observed that the appellant has asked only for statistical details and not names of individuals. Therefore, the argument of \"un warranted invasion of privacy of individuals\" is very weak and hence not accepted\\' and resultantly, allowed the appeal by directing the public authority (Writ Petitioner) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order.\\n\\n3.According to the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Registrar General, High Court of Madras, the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai is legally void and therefore, it is liable to be set aside. 4.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urges before this Court that the impugned order has been passed in violation of the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005 and as such, it is void ab initio. 5.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contends that the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, while passing the impugned order dated 10.01.2012, has failed to appreciate an important fact that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is infringing the internal administration of Hon\\'ble High Court of Madras. 6.Yet another submission of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that if the request of the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is acceded to by the High Court of Madras, then, it will set a bad precedent for others. 7.Per contra, the 1st Respondent/Petitioner submits that he has enrolled as an Advocate in the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in the year 1986 and is practising before the High Court of Madras and before the trial Courts in Chennai. Also that, he is engaged in various social activities. Furthermore, he was appointed as an Assistant Solicitor General of India in the High Court of Madras during the period 2008-2009. He served as Special Government Pleader for the Tamil Nadu State during the year 2006 - 2008. 8.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner that he is the legal advisor of several Residents\\' Welfare Associations and Traders\\' Welfare Associations at K.K. Nagar, Chennai 600 078. He served as President of Rotary Club of Madras, T.Nagar (2005-2006) and General Secretary of Anti Bribe Coalition, (a public trust) a wing of EXNORA international and an active member of India Against Corruption. 9.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner contends that he approached the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras to find out the mechanism and structure the High Court has to take action against the corrupt employees and the Presiding Officers of the Subordinate Judiciary and sought certain information, by means of queries, as referred in para 3 of the Affidavit filed by the Writ Petitioner. 10.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, the information sought for by him are all matters defined under Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. As a matter of fact, those information do not come within Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\n11.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner lodged an Appeal dated 20.12.2010 before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner). But the Appellate Authority had not furnished information sought for by him vide his letter dated 01.11.2010. As such, he was perforced to prefer Second Appeal to the Information Commissioner on 18.03.2011. The 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, through its direction dated 23.03.2011, has transmitted the petition dated 16.03.2011 of the 1st Respondent for taking appropriate action. Also, the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission has sought the remarks of the Writ Petitioner/Registrar General by 27.04.2011 for the said petition. The Registrar (Administration)/Public Information Officer of the Petitioner/High Court sent a reply dated 27.04.2011 to the Registrar of the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission stating that the remarks called for in the matter would be furnished shortly. However, the Writ Petitioner (Appellate Authority), on 29.04.2011, sent a letter to the Information Commission (marking a copy to him) denying the information. However, the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai passed an order on 10.01.2012 directing the Petitioner/Appellant to furnish the informations to the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner. 12.The Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission submits that the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, as a citizen, has a statutory right, to obtain the informations sought for by him, through his Letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the Writ Petitioner/High Court. Further, Section 4 of the Act speaks of \\'Obligations of the Public Authority\\'. As such, the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant through his Letter dated 01.11.2010 do squarely come within the purview of Section 4 of the Act. 13.The Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent urges before this Court that Section 22 of the Right to Information Act enjoins that the provisions of the Act have an overriding effect on the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923) and any other law for the time being in force etc. Viewed in that perspective, it is contended that the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, by his Letter dated 01.11.2010, can be supplied by the Petitioner/High Court, because of the reason that he has sought for statistical particulars and names of individuals concerned. In short, the Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent contends that the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission does not suffer from any impropriety or illegality, in the eye of law. 14.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner in his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to Public Information Officer of High Court relates to the internal administration of the Madras High Court and the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner from Serial Nos.1 to 9 in his application dated 01.11.2010, if furnished would cause an invasion of privacy of the individuals. Therefore, under the ingredients of Section 8(e) and (f) of the Act, the Writ Petitioner is exempted to disclose the information sought for. Also, as per Section 8(i) of the\\n\\nAct, the Petitioner/High Court is exempted to disclose the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner. 15.To lend support to the contention that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of High Court, Madras, cannot be acceded to by the Petitioner, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner cites the order of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.27734 of 2012 (@ CC 14781/2012) dated 03.10.2012 between Girish Ramchandra Deshpande V. Cen. Information Commissioner & Others, wherein in paragraphs 12 to 16, it is observed and laid down as follows: \"12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and also the details of his investments, lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is whether the above-mentioned information sought for qualifies to be personal informationas defined in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act. 13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of censure /punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information as defined in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act. The performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of right. 14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are personal informationwhich stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. 15. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide public interest in seeking information, the disclosure of such information would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n16. We are, therefore, of the view that the petitioner has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought for is for the larger public interest. That being the fact, we are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition. Hence, the same is dismissed.\" 16.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner also seeks in aid of the order of this Court dated 12.02.2010 in W.P.Nos.8068 and 8069 of 2008 between M.Velayutham V. The Registrar, Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Teynampet, Chennai- 18 & 3 others, wherein in paragraphs 10 and 11, it is observed and held as follows: \"10.Before closing the case it must be noted that whenever a person challenges the order of the State or Central Information Commission, it is not necessary to make the Commission a party to the writ petition. The Commission is a statutory appellate authority and is expected to function within the four corners of the RTI Act. If its orders are under challenge, the Commission is not expected to defend it. In a writ for certiorari the order will have to speak for itself. If the Commission is made as a party, it will be an unnecessary drain on the Commission to engage counsel to defend its orders. In no case a court is expected to defend its decisions. More often, the Commission\\'s orders are challenged by the Government departments or information officers at the expense of the Government. In these cases, the applicant who sought the information will be a party and will be expected to defend his request. 11.Only for the purpose of calling for records or sending a copy of the order, the Information Commission need not be made as a party. If the persons who do not file proper records, then a notice may be sent by the Registry to call for the records if ordered by the courts. Likewise, on complicated matters if any legal assistance is required, the Court can appoint an \\'amicus curiae\\' to help the Court. The orders of the Court on all matters involving the Right to Information Act, as a matter of routine, can be marked to the appropriate Commission. The Registry shall henceforth must ask the counsel who files writ petitions to delete the Information Commission from the array of parties. This will not only reduce the paper work and administrative difficulties faced by the Commission, besides saving them draining their meagre resources.\" 17.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras, has sought the following information by raising queries to be furnished to him. They are as follows: \"1.How may Subordinate Judges are there in service in the state of Tamil Nadu. The district-wise list may be furnished to me as per the hierarchy? 2.How may employees are serving in the judicial department in the whole of Tamil Nadu (including the Government servants on deputation)?\\n\\n3.How many judicial officers, police officers and staffs are working in the Vigilance Department of the registry of Madras High Court? 4.Does your vigilance department is having any branches in the district so as to receive the complaint from the general public against the judicial officer and court staffs? 5.Does your registry is having any tie up or coordination with the office of Vigilance and Anti-corruption, Rajaannamalai Puram, Chennai 28 to trap the judicial officers or court staffs on the basis of the complaints from the affected persons? 6.Does your registry is having special team for trapping the corrupt judicial officers and court staffs? 7.Between 2001 to 2010 how many complaints have been received by your Registry and Vigilance Department, kindly give complaint wise break up figure (that is how many complaints against DJ, ADDLJ, SJ, DMC, FTC Judges, Magistrates and Court staffs)? 8.How many complaints ended in dismissal, suspension, issuance of memo and dropping of the case and conviction between the said 2001 to 2010? 9.Between 2001 to 2010 how many complaints against High Court staffs have been received relating to bribe and the fate of those complaints?\" 18.It transpires that the 1st Respondent/Petitioner has filed an Appeal under Section 19 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 on 20.12.2010 before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner). Since the Public Information Officer of the High Court had not furnished him the required information sought for by him through his letter dated 01.11.2010. In the Appeal filed by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner) dated 20.12.2010, he had sought for the information earlier sought for by him as per his Application dated 01.11.2010. Inasmuch as the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner was not furnished with the requisite informations sought for by him, by the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority, he filed Second Appeal before the Tamil Nadu State Information Commission, Chennai praying for issuance of a direction to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority to furnish the informations, as sought for by him, in his letter dated 01.11.2010 with cost and penalty to be imposed. 19.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission in Case No.10447/ Enquiry/A/20 issued summons dated 16.03.2011 to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras requiring him to appear before the Commission in person along with all original records on 21.12.2011 at 3.30 p.m. for further consideration of the matter.\\n\\n20.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, on 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed an order by not accepting the argument \"un warranted invasion of privacy of individuals\" and allowed the Appeal by directing the Petitioner/Public Authority to furnish the details sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order. 21.It is to be borne in mind that under the Right to Information Act, 2005 as an authority has a rudimentary function to perform either to furnish the information or deny the information. As a matter of fact, there is no specific Article in the Constitution of India which provides for the citizens right to know. However, Article 19(1)(a) provides for freedom of thought and expression which indirectly includes right to obtain information. Further, Article 21 guarantees right to life and personal liberty to citizens. Undoubtedly, Right to Life is incomplete if basic human right viz., \\'Right to Know\\' is not included within its umbrage. 22.Right to information is seen in Article 19(1)(a), 14 and 21 of the Constitution. 23.It is not out of place for this Court to point out that Sections 1 and 2 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 deal with title, commencement and definitions of important terms employed under the Act. Sections 6 and 7 specified procedure for submitting the requisition for obtaining information and disposal of applications. Section 8 deals with cases of exemption from disclosure of information, when such disclosure affects prejudicial the sovereignty and integrity of India etc. Section 9 deals with Grounds for rejection of applications. Section 18 deals with the Powers and Functions of the Central Information Commission or the State Information Commission as the case may be. 24.It is to be noted that Section 2(e) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 defines the term \\'Competent authority\\' meaning, \"(i) the Speaker in the case of the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of a State or a Union territory having such Assembly and the Chairman in the case of the Council of States or Legislative Council of a State; (ii) the Chief Justice of India in the case of the Supreme Court; (iii) the Chief Justice of the High Court in the case of a High Court; (iv) the President or the Governor, as the case may be, in the case of other authorities established or constituted by or under the Constitution; (v) the administrator appointed under article 239 of the Constitution.\"\\n\\n25.Section 2(f) of the Act defines \\'Information\\' as follows: \"(f) information means any material in any form, including records, documents,memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force.\" 26.Also, Section 2(h) of the Act means \\'Public Authority\\' as under: \"any authority or body or institution of self government established or constituted- (a) by or under the Constitution; (b) by any other law made by Parliament; (c) by any other law made by State Legislature; (d) by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government, and includes any- (i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed; (ii)non-Government organisation substantially financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government; (i) recordincludes- (a) any document, manuscript and file; (b) any microfilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document; (c) any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarged or not); and (iii)(d) any other material produced by a computer or any other device.\" 27.Section 2(j) of the Act defines \\'Right to Information\\' meaning, \"the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to- (i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records;\\n\\n(iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device.\" 28.As per Section 6 of the Right to Information Act, if a person desires to obtain an information shall make a request in writing or through electronic means in English or Hindi or in the official language along with prescribed fee to the concerned public authority. 29.It is true that the applicant is not required to furnish any reason requiring the information or any personal details except those that may be necessary for the purpose of contacting him. 30.Soon after the receipt of request for supplying/furnishing of information, the Central Public Information Officer/State Public Information Officer is to deal with the matter in issue within 30 days. If the information sought for relates to the life or liberty of an individual, the same is to be provided within 48 hours of the receipt of request. If the concerned officer fails to render his decision within 30 days or 48 hours as the case may be, he shall be deem to have refused the request. 31.In case, the information is to be furnished on payment of any fee, the Officer is required to send an intimation to the requisitionist together with relevant particulars of fee. 32.If a physically challenged person requires an access to the record, then, the Officer is to provide an assistance to enable him to get an access to the information. Indeed, no fee is to be charged in regard to the persons who are below the poverty line. However, if the public authority fails to provide information within the specified limits which are to be provided on payment of fee, it shall be provided free of charge. 33.Where a request has been rejected, the concerned officer is to communicate the reasons for denying the request, the time limit within which an Appeal may be filed and the relevant particulars of the Appellate Authority to the concerned individual who has made the request.\\n\\n34.It cannot be gainsaid that under the Right to Information Act, 2005, the Public Information Officer concerned is an independent authority, in law. If the said Officer fails to furnish the informations sought for by the concerned Applicant, within the time specified under the Act, then, in law, it amounts to deemed rejection/denial of request. However, if the Public Information Officer malafidely denies/rejects the request of an Applicant either wholly or in part, then, he can be proceeded with under the Right to Information Act, 2005. 35.For denying the information as per Section 8(e) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, the following paramount factors may be taken into consideration. (a)Whether supplying/furnishing information on public records would impede the investigation/apprehension/prosecution; (b)Whether the information is such that can be refused/denied to Parliament or State Legislature; (c)Whether public interest in disclosure earns the protected interest; (d)Section 22 of the Right to Information Act has an overriding effect and as such, the legal procedure enshrined for quasi judicial proceedings gets overridden by the Right to Information Act. 36.In this connection, this Court worth recalls the decision of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Namit Sharma V. Union of India [2013-2-L.W.1 at page 2] wherein it is laid down as follows: \"The Right to Information, like any other right, is not an unlimited or unrestricted right. It is subject to statutory and constitutional limitations. The doctrine of severability finds place in the statue in the shape of Section 10 of the Act of 2005\". 37.Indeed, Section 18 of the Right to Information Act deals with the Powers and Functions of the Commission. Section 18(3) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 enjoins as follows: \"(a) summoning and enforcing the attendance of persons and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce the documents or things; (b) requiring the discovery and inspection of documents; (c) receiving evidence on affidavit;\\n\\n(d) requisitioning any public record or copies thereof from any court or office; (e) issuing summons for examination of witnesses or documents; and (f) any other matter which may be prescribed.\" Also, Section 18(4) of the Act, runs thus: \"(4)Notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other Act of Parliament or State Legislature, as the case may be, the Central Information Commission or the State Information Commission, as the case may be, may, during the inquiry of any complaint under this Act, examine any record to which this Act applies which is under the control of the public authority, and no such record may be withheld from it on any grounds.\" 38.From the reading of the ingredients of Section 18 of the Act, it is crystal clear that the State Information Commission has power to conduct an enquiry in a given case. It is to be remembered that the Information Commission is only required to find out whether the endorsement issued by the Public In formation Officer is in confirmity with the Right to Information Act, 2005 and whether the information which is sought for has been intentionally/deliberately held back or the same has not been furnished within the specified time. 39.It is to be pointed out that in an Appeal filed under Section 19 of the Act, under Section 18(4) of the Act, the State Information Commission before passing an order (relating to an information of a third party) has to issue a Notice to the third party for the purpose of providing a reasonable opportunity [obviously, in terms of the Principles of Natural Justice]. Coming to Section 20 of the Act, in regard to the imposition of penalty under Section 20 of the Act, the same is undoubtedly penal in nature. Before awarding any penalty, on an Official/Officer, a reasonable opportunity is to be provided to the deviant concerned. However, the directions/recommendations of the State Information Commission to initiate action against an deviant/ errant Public Information Officer are not binding on the appropriate authority. It is purely within the ambit of the Public Authority/ Competent Authority either to concur with the directions/ recommendations so issued/made or not to concur with the same. 40.It cannot be gainsaid that the Information Commission exercises judicial powers and it is a Tribunal entrusted with the task of adjudicating upon special matters and disputes\\n\\nbetween the parties. The Commission is a Tribunal vested with the appellate power to decide the appeals etc., as per the decision in Poornaprajna House Building Co-operative Society Limited V. Karnataka Information Commission & others, [AIR 2007 Karnataka 136]. Furthermore, in the said decision at page 136, it is observed as follows: \"It is settled that any authority or body of persons constituted by law or having legal authority to adjudicate upon questions affecting the rights of a subject and enjoined with a duty to act judicially or quasi judicially is amenable to the certiorari jurisdiction of the High Court. Similarly, Art. 227 of the Constitution confers on every High Court the power of superintendence over all Courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction excepting any Court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to armed forces. Thus, the orders of the Commission are amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court.\" 41.In the decision Ahmedabad Education Society & Another V. Union of India & Others, [AIR 2008 Gujarat 42 at page 44], it is inter alia observed as follows: \"Looking to the provisions of Section 18 of the Act,2005, State Chief Information Commissioner can hold an inquiry and can impose penalty upon erring officer. No order can be passed against the third party otherwise right of first appeal as well as second appeal of third party will be taken away. Looking to the facts of the present case, it is clear that the State Chief Information Commissioner has exceeded his jurisdiction under the Act,2005. (iv) Order passed without giving an opportunity of being heard, lead to arbitrariness. Arbitrariness and equality are sworn enemies of each other. Where arbitrariness is present, equality is always, absent and where equality is present, arbitrariness is absent. In the facts of this case, there is gross violation of principles of natural justice. Hence, the order is arbitrary and ,therefore, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\" 42.This Court aptly points out the decision of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Namit Sharma V. Union of India, [2013-2-L.W.1] at special page 41 & 42, in paragraphs 99 to 102, wherein it is observed as follows: \"99.Persons of eminence in public life is also an expression of wide implication and ramifications. It takes in its ambit all requisites of a good citizen with values and having a public image of contribution to the society. Such person should have understanding of concepts of public interest and public good. Most importantly, such person should have contributed to the society through social or allied works. The authorities cannot lose sight of the fact that ingredients of institutional integrity would be applicable by necessary implication to the\\n\\nCommissions and their members. This discussion safely leads us to conclude that the functions of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners may be better performed by a legally qualified and trained mind possessing the requisite experience. The same should also be applied to the designation of the first appellate authority, i.e., the senior officers to be designated at the Centre and State levels. However, in view of language of Section 5, it may not be necessary to apply this principle to the designation of Public Information Officer. 100. Moreover, as already noticed, the Information Commission, is performing quasi-judicial functions and essence of its adjudicatory powers is akin to the Court system. It also possesses the essential trappings of a Court and discharges the functions which have immense impact on the rights/ obligations of the parties. Thus, it must be termed as a judicial Tribunal which requires to be manned by a person of judicial mind, expertise and experience in that field. This Court, while dealing with the cases relating to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution has observed that every provision of the Constitution, can be amended provided in the result, the basic structure of the Constitution remains the same. The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights contained in Part III of the Constitution and their protection itself has been treated as the basic structure of the Constitution. 101. Besides separation of powers, the independence of judiciary is of fundamental constitutional value in the structure of our Constitution. Impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in judicial decision making are the hallmarks of the Judiciary. If Impartiality is the soul of Judiciary, `Independence\\' is the life blood of Judiciary. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive, as this Court stated in the case of Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association [(2010) 11 SCC 17]. 102. The independence of judiciary stricto sensu applies to the Court system. Thus, by necessary implication, it would also apply to the tribunals whose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the court system. The entire administration of justice system has to be so independent and managed by persons of legal acumen, expertise and experience that the persons demanding justice must not only receive justice, but should also have the faith that justice would be done.\" Also, in the aforesaid decision at page 42 in paragraph 103, it is held as follows: \"103. The above detailed analysis leads to an ad libitum conclusion that under the provisions and scheme of the Act of 2005, the persons eligible for appointment should be of public eminence, with knowledge and experience in the specified fields and should preferably have a judicial background. They should possess judicial acumen and experience to fairly and effectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would come up for determination before the Commission, in its day-to-day working. The Commission satisfies abecedarians of a judicial tribunal which has the trappings of a court. It will serve the ends of justice better, if the\\n\\nInformation Commission was manned by persons of legal expertise and with adequate experience in the field of adjudication. We may further clarify that such judicial members could work individually or in Benches of two, one being a judicial member while the other being a qualified person from the specified fields to be called an expert member. Thus, in order to satisfy the test of constitutionality, we will have to read into Section 12(5) of the Act that the expression knowledge and experienceincludes basic degree in that field and experience gained thereafter and secondly that legally qualified, trained and experienced persons would better administer justice to the people, particularly when they are expected to undertake an adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and niceties of law. Such appreciation and application of legal principles is a sine qua non to the determinative functioning of the Commission as it can tilt the balance of justice either way. Malcolm Gladwell said, the key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are lacking in the latter. The requirement of a judicial mind for manning the judicial tribunal is a well accepted discipline in all the major international jurisdictions with hardly with any exceptions. Even if the intention is to not only appoint people with judicial background and expertise, then the most suitable and practical resolution would be that a judicial member and an expert memberfrom other specified fields should constitute a Bench and perform the functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2005. Such an approach would further the mandate of the statute by resolving the legal issues as well as other serious issues like an inbuilt conflict between the Right to Privacy and Right to Information while applying the balancing principle and other incidental controversies. We would clarify that participation by qualified persons from other specified fields would be a positive contribution in attainment of the proper administration of justice as well as the object of the Act of 2005.Such an approach would help to withstand the challenge to the constitutionality of Section 12(5).\" 43.At this stage, we deem it appropriate to cite the following decisions in furtherance of substantial cause of justice: (a)In the decision Kunche Durga Prasad and another V. Public Information Officer, Office of Chief Manager (HR) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Rajamundry & others, [AIR 2010 Andra Pradesh 105] at page 106 in paragraph 6 and 7, it is observed as follows: \"6.Neither the 1st petitioner nor any other unsuccessful applicants have filed application before the 1st respondent pointing out any grievance. The 2nd respondent, who is an advocate, filed the application seeking information as referred to above. The 1st respondent furnished information on 13.02.2009 wherein it was mentioned that 73 SC candidates were selected; not an individual officer but a committee has selected the candidates; and a list indicating the particulars of posting orders of all the 284 candidates was furnished. So far as the request to furnish the copies of qualification certificates submitted by the selected candidates is concerned, the 1st respondent took the view that such an information is exempted under\\n\\nSection 8(1)(j) of the Act. The 2nd petitioner filed an appeal under Section 19 of the Act before the 3rd respondent. The latter upheld the view taken by the 1st respondent. Therefore, it needs to be seen as to whether the information sought for by the 2nd petitioner i.e. furnishing copies of the qualification certificates of the selected candidates is not exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The said provision reads as under: 8. Exemption from disclosure of information:-- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,- ........ (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. 7.From a perusal of the above, it is evident that the exemption gets attracted under two circumstances namely, (a) if the information is personal in nature and has no relationship to any public activity or interest, and (b) furnishing of the same would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual. These exemptions are, however, subject to the opinion that may be formed by the Central or State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\" Moreover, in the aforesaid decision at page 107, in paragraph 10 and 11, it is observed as follows: \"10.The 2nd petitioner is not able to state as to how the copies of qualification certificates of the selected candidates have any characteristics of public activity or partake public interest. The aggrieved parties including the 1st petitioner have already approached this Court by filing W.P.No.17355 of 2008. Such of the selected candidates who are impleaded in that writ petition would certainly have to defend themselves. Any direction to the respondents herein to furnish the testimonials of the selected candidates to the petitioners would have its own impact upon the pleadings or the stands which the parties to the pending proceedings may take. It may appear to be enterprising or tempting for any one to have access to every possible information for an individual whether it relates to an individual or not. The freedom of an individual to have access to the information cannot be projected to such an extent as to invade the rights of others. Further, Section 6(2) of the Act cannot be read in isolation, nor can be interpreted to\\n\\nmean that an applicant can seek every information relating to any one. Just as he cannot be compelled to divulge the purpose for which he needs the information, he must respect the right of the other man to keep the facts relating to him, close to his chest, unless compelled by law to disclose the same. It is relevant to mention that even where an individual is placed under obligation to speak, the law can only draw adverse inference from his failure or refused to speak but cannot go further to invade his privacy or private life. 11.The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the view taken by the respondents conflicts with the very spirit of Section 6(2) of the Act. This contention cannot be accepted for the simple reason that Section 8 of the Act, on one hand, and the Section 6 of the Act, on the other hand, operate in different and distinct fields. Though Section 6(2) of the Act enables every individual to seek information without disclosing the purpose, the information that can be furnished to him is subject to the restrictions placed under Section 8 of the Act. Therefore, no exception can be taken to the impugned orders. (b)In the decision Rajasthan Public Service Commission V. Ms.Pooja Meena & Another, [AIR 2012 Rajasthan 52] at page 53, in paragraph 11, it is observed as follows: \"11.To the valued observations of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court, this Court would respectfully add that the provisions of RTI Act cannot be used as a tool to give vent to the frustration and dissatisfaction of a citizen as in the present case without anything more. The present case relates to RAS Examination 2007, which have long been concluded and appointments made thereunder. A dissatisfied candidate who is disbelieving in the process of a constitutional body, ought not be allowed to continue pursuing the RPSC and seek information which can affect the efficient working and discharge of its constitutional obligations without any corresponding benefit or relationship to any public interest or activity. The impugned order dated 14.10.2010 is a mechanical order and does not disclose a careful consideration of the matter before the Chief Information Commissioner.\" (c)In Khandapuram Gandaiah V. The Administrative Officer, Ranga Reddy District Courts and Others, [AIR 2009 Andhra Pradesh 174], at page 178, it is observed that \\'Though Sections 8(1)(b) and 24 of the Act do not provide any exemption to the Judges or judicial officers from giving the information sought for\\' and further, it is held that \\'The Petitioner has no locus to raise this contention because he can seek only information under the Right to Information Act\\'. 44.Coming to the aspect of non disclosure of information, it is to be pointed out that the ingredients of Section 8 and 11 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, there is total bar on 6 out\\n\\nof 10 exceptions i.e. 1(a), (b), (c), (f), (g) & (h). Insofar as the matters covered by Section 8(1)(d), (e)(h) and (i) of Section 8 of the Act, the Information Officers are necessarily to record a finding by taking into account the relative merit between the Public interest and secrecy. If the public interest outweighs private interest, then, the information has to be furnished. Otherwise, the Officer is entitled to assign reasons for refusing to supply/furnish the information in question. 45.Coming to the aspect of Right to Information Act, 2005 which has an overriding effect on the Official Secrets Act, 1923 and any other law for the time being in force with a view to achieve the object of reducing corruption and to maintain transparency in public activity/ dealing, at this juncture, we deem it appropriate to recall the observations of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Mohandas Lalwani V. The State of Madhya Pradesh, [AIR 1973 Supreme Court 2679 at p.2684], wherein it is observed as under: \"... As long as an impression exists that corruption is prevalent and that unless one pays to somebody things are not done, there would be always persons who would feel the urge to offer bribe. Bribe would be offered not only to get an undue favour but also to avoid unnecessary harassment and to see that no obstruction or delay is caused in getting the most legitimate work done. To prevent the repetition of crimes like the one of which the appellant has been found guilty, it is necessary to inculcate a general feeling that things are done in due course uninfluenced by extraneous considerations.\" 46.Also, we aptly point out the following decisions of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court, to secure the ends of Justice: (a) In Swatantar Singh V. State of Haryana and others, [AIR 1997 Supreme Court 2105 at p. 2106], it is laid down as follows: \"It is sad but a bitter reality that corruption is corroding, like cancerous lymph nodes, the vital veins of the body politics, social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers. The efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently, truthfully, honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post. The reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoreity much faster than the smoke.\" (b)In High Court of Judicature at Bombay through its Registrar V. Shirish Kumar Rangrao Patil and another, [AIR 1997 Supreme Court 2631] at page 2639 & 2640, in paragraph 16, it is observed as follows:\\n\\n\"16.Corruption, appears to have spread everywhere. No facet of public function has been left unaffected by the putrefied stinck of corruption. Corruption, thy name is depraved and degraded conduct. Dishonesty is thine true colour; thine corroding effect is deep and pervasive; spreads like lymph-nodes, cancerous cells in human body spreading as wild fire eating away the vital veins in the efficacy of public functions. It is a sad fact that corruption has its roots and semification in the society as whole. In the widest connotation, corruption includes improper or selfish exercise of power and influence attached to a public office. The root of corruption is nepotism and apathy in control on narrow considerations which often extends passive protection to the corrupt officers. The source and succour for acceptability of the judgment to be correct, is the upright conduct, character, absolute integrity and displayed on and off the Bench becomes centre stage of the judicial officer. Fallen standard of rectitude is the bane for lost faith of the people, tending to defeat the constitutional scheme of conferment of the powers of judicial review or decision according to law unless checks and corrective measures are applied and enforced. The conferment of exclusive power of judicial review on the judiciary may become means to personal gain or advantage. The Tymph-nodes (cancerous cells ) of corruption constantly keep creeping into the vital veins of judiciary and the need to stem it out by judicial surgery lies on judiciary itself by its self-imposed or corrective measures or disciplinary action under the doctrine of control enshrined in Articles 235,124(6) of the constitution. It would, therefore, be necessary that there should be constant vigil by the High Court concerned on its subordinate judiciary and self-introspection. What is most necessary is to stem out the proclivity of the corrupt conduct rather than to catch when the corrupt demands made and acceptance of illegal gratification. Corruption in judiciary cannot be committed without some members of the Bar become privy to the corrupt. The vigilant watch by the High court, and many a time by the members of the Bar, is the sustaining stream to catch the corrupt and to deal with the situation appropriately. At the same time the High Court is the protector of the subordinate judiciary. Often some members of the bar, in particular, in Muffasil courts, attempt to take undue advantage of their long standing at the bar and attempt to abuse their standing by bringing or attempting to bring about diverse form of pressures and pin-pricks on junior judicial officers or stubborn and stern and unbendable officers. If they remain unsuccessful, to achieve their nefarious purpose, some members of the Bar indulge in mudslinging without any base, by sending repeated anonymous letters against the judicial officer questioning their performance/capacity/integrity. The High Court should, therefore, take care of the judicial officers and protect them from such unseeming attempts or pressures so as to maintain their morale and independence or the judicial officer and support the honest and upright officers.\" 47.That apart, in the decision of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in S.P.Gupta and others V. President of India and others, [AIR 1982 Supreme Court 149], it is held that \\'the Right to know has been given a constitutional status by treating it as a part of speech and expression and thereby bringing this right within Art.19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India\\'.\\n\\n48.It will be quite in the fitness of things to recall the Golden words of Thomas JefferSon, who rightly said that \\'Information is the Currency of Democracy\\'. 49.In the words Amartya Sen, \\'the Right to Information Act, 2005 is a momentous engagement with the possibilities of freedom\\'. [vide Lawz January 2008 at page 40 special page 41]. 50.Befittingly, we recall the observation of Lord Goff in the decision Attorney General V. Guardian Newspapers Limited and others (No 2) 1990 1 A.P. at page 109 which runs as follows: \" Although the basis of Law\\'s protection of confidence is that there is a Law, nevertheless the public interest may be outweighed by some other countervailing public interest which favours disclosure.\" 51.We aptly point out that on going through the tenor of Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act pertaining to \\'Information\\' stated thereunder, we are of the cocksure opinion that the same does not include within its fold the personal information of the officials, staff members/officers to the public authority viz., High Court, in the instant case on hand. Section 3 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 speaks of \\'All citizens to have the right to information, subject to the provisions of the Act\\'. Section 4 of the Act refers to \\'Obligations of public authorities\\'. Every public authority under the Act owes a duty to specify reasons of any administrative orders or quasi-judicial decisions to the affected/aggrieved persons as per the decision in Satyan A. V. Government of Kerala, [2008 (4) K.H.C. at page 120 & 121]. 52.In the decision B.Bindhu V. Secretary, Tamil Nadu Circle Postal Co-operative Bank Limited, Chennai, [AIR 2007 Madras 13 at page 14], it is held that \\'The petitioner is not entitled to the details sought for by her under the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005\\'. 53.Under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 the Officers are not required to provide private or personal information which is exempted. As a matter of fact, the informations relating to employees in High Court/Subordinate Courts/Judicial Officers etc. are inter se matters between an employer and employee in an institution which are purely governed by respective service rules. In fact, it partakes the character of \\'personal information\\', the disclosure of the same has no public interest or public activity. It cannot be lost sight of that under the concept of \\'Right to Know\\', a Public Information Officer is not supposed to be harassed or persecuted/prosecuted.\\n\\n54.It is to be pointed out that the personal information and the information between persons in fiduciary relationship is exempted from disclosure under the Right to Information Act. Also, \\'Confidence\\' may be outweighed by public interest in the matter of such disclosure. 55.The Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent cites the decision of High Court of Delhi in Secretary General, Supreme Court of India V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, [2010 (1) CTC 241] (Full Bench), wherein it is held as under: \"Every citizen is entitled to information held by or under Control of Public Authority unless it is exempted by Section 8(1) of the Right to Information Act etc.\" 56.Moreover, it is held that \\'The Resolution of Full Court of the Honourable Supreme Court treating declaration of assets by Judges as confidential does not make it any less information which citizen is entitled to access\\'. 57.As against the Judgment in L.P.A.No.501/2009, dated 12.01.2010 (by the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court) between Secretary General, Supreme Court of India and Subhash Chandra Agarwal, the Central Public Information Officer of Supreme Court of India and another (on the file of the Honourable Supreme Court of India) has filed Civil Appeal No.10044 of 2010 (arising out of SLP (C)No.32855 of 2009) and the Honourable Supreme Court with C.A.10045/2010 @ SLP (C)No.32856 of 2009, the Central Public Information Officer of Supreme Court of India and another V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal and Civil Appeal No.2683 of 2010, Secretary General, Supreme Court of India V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, has framed the following substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution for consideration. \"1.Whether the concept of independence of judiciary requires and demands the prohibition of furnishing of the information sought? Whether the information sought for amounts to interference in the functioning of the judiciary? 2.Whether the information sought for cannot be furnished to avoid any erosion in the credibility of the decisions and to ensure a free and frank expression of honest opinion by all the constitutional functionaries, which is essential for effective consultation and for taking the right decision?\\n\\n3.Whether the information sought for is exempt under Section 8(i)(j) of the Right to Information Act? 16. The above questions involve the interpretation of the Constitution raise great and fundamental issues.\" and directed the Registry to place this matter before the Hon\\'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of Bench for appropriate strength. 58.We aptly point out the decision of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan V. Ramesh Chand Paliwal and another, [AIR 1998 Supreme Court 1079], it is observed as follows: \"Art.229 makes Chief Justice of the High Court the supreme authority in the matter of appointment of the High Court officers and servants. This Article also confers rule making power on the Chief Justice for regulating the conditions of service of officers and servants of the High Court subject to certain restrictions. The power available to the Chief Justice of the High Court, under Art. 229, is akin to the power of the Chief Justice of India under Art. 146. Just as Chief Justice of India is the supreme authority in the matter of Supreme Court Establishment including its office staff and officers, so also the Chief Justice of the High Court is the sole authority in these matters and no other Judge or officer can legally usurp those administrative functions or power.\" 59.Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of respective contentions and on going through the contents of the application dated 01.11.2010 filed by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, this Court is of the considered view that the information sought for by him in Serial Nos.1 to 9 pertaining to the internal delicate functioning/administration of the High Court besides the same relate to invasion of privacy of respective individuals if the informations so asked for are furnished and more so, the informations sought for have no relationship to any public activity or interest. Moreover, the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant, through his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Chennai, are not to a fuller extent open to public domain. Added further, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of High Court, are divulged, then, it will open floodgates/Pandora Box compelling the Petitioner/High Court to supply the informations sought for by the concerned Requisitionists as a matter of routine, without any rhyme or reasons/restrictions as the case may be. Therefore, some self restrictions are to be imposed in regard to the supply of informations in this regard. As a matter of fact, the Notings, Jottings, Administrative Letters, Intricate Internal Discussions, Deliberations etc. of the Petitioner/High Court cannot be brought under Section 2(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, in our considered opinion of this Court. Also that, if the informations relating to Serial Nos.1 to 9 mentioned in the application of the 1st Respondent/Applicant dated 01.11.2010 are\\n\\ndirected to be furnished or supplied with, then, certainly, it will impede and hinder the regular, smooth and proper functioning of the Institution viz., High Court (an independent authority under the Constitution of India, free from Executive or Legislature), as opined by this Court. As such, a Saner Counsel/Balancing Act is to be adopted in matters relating to the application of the Right to Information Act, 2005, so that an adequate freedom and inbuilt safeguard can be provided to the Hon\\'ble Chief Justice of High Court [competent authority and public authority as per Section 2(e)(iii) and 2(h)(a) of the Act 22 of 2005] in exercising his discretionary powers either to supply the information or to deny the information, as prayed for by the Applicants/Requisitionists concerned. 60.Apart from the above, if the informations requested by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, based on his letter dated 01.11.2010, are supplied with, then, it will have an adverse impact on the regular and normal, serene functioning of the High Court\\'s Office on the Administrative side. Therefore, we come to an irresistible conclusion that the 1st Respondent/Applicant is not entitled to be supplied with the informations/details sought for by him, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. Even on the ground of (i) maintaining confidentiality; (ii) based on the reason that the private or personal information is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act, 2005; and (iii) also under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act in lieu of fiduciary relationship maintained by the High Court, the request of the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his Letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010 under Section 19 of the Act to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority, cannot be acceded to by this Court. Further, we are of the considered view that the 1st Respondent/Applicant has no locus standi to seek for the details sought for by him, as stated supra, in a wholesale, omnibus and mechanical fashion in the subject matter in issue, (either as a matter of right/routine under the Right to Information Act) because of the simple reason that he has no enforceable legal right. Also, we opine that the 1st Respondent/Applicant\\'s requests, through his Application dated 01.11.2010 and his Appeal dated 20.12.2010, suffer from want of bonafides (notwithstanding the candid fact that Section 6 of the Right to Information Act does not either overtly or covertly refers to the \\'concept of Locus\\'). 61.To put it differently, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010, are divulged or furnished by the Office of the High Court (on administrative side), then, the secrecy and privacy of the internal working process may get jeopardised, besides the furnishing of said informations would result in invasion of unwarranted and uncalled for privacy of individuals concerned. Even the disclosure of informations pertaining to departmental enquiries in respect of Disciplinary Actions initiated against the Judicial Officers/Officials of the Subordinate Court or the High Court will affect the facile, smooth and independent running of the administration of the High\\n\\nCourt, under the Constitution of India. Moreover, as per Section 2(e) of the read with Section 28 of the Right to Information Act, the Hon\\'ble Chief Justice of this Court is empowered to frame rules to carry out the provisions of the Act. In this regard, we point out that \\'Madras High Court Right to Information (Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules, 2007\\' have been framed [vide R.O.C.No.2636-A/06/F1 SRO C-3/2008] in Tamil Nadu Gazette, No.20, dated 21.05.2008, Pt.III, S.2. Also, a Notification, in Roc.No.976 A/2008/RTI dated 18.11.2008, has been issued by this Court to the said Rules, by bringing certain amendments in regard to the Name and Designation of the Officers mentioned therein, the same has come into force from 18.11.2008. 62.In the upshot of quantitative and qualitative discussions mentioned supra, we hold that the view taken by the 2nd Respondent/ Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, in Appeal Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 that \\'the appellant has asked only for statistical details and not names of individuals\\', is per se not correct. As such, the conclusion arrived at by the 2nd Respondent/ Information Commission, in allowing the Appeal and directing the Petitioner/High Court (Public Authority) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order, is not sustainable, in the eye of law. Therefore, to prevent an aberration of Justice and to promote substantial cause of Justice, this Court interferes with the order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai and sets aside the same, to secure the ends of Justice. Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed. Sgl\\n\\nTo 1. The Registrar General, High Court of Madras, Chennai 600 104. 2.

Respondent\\n\\nPrayer: Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying this Court to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus calling for records relating to the impugned order passed by the respondent in Valakku No.24699/Visaranai/B/2013 (40916/B/2013) (22707/B/2014) dated 21.01.2016 and quash the same as illegal and for a consequential direction to the respondent to provide information as sought by the petitioner in his application dated 15.03.2013 under the Act within a period that may be stipulated by this Hon\\'ble Court.\\n\\n!For Petitioner : Mr.M.E.Ilango ^For Respondent : Mr.K.K.Senthil\\n\\n:ORDER\\n\\nThis Writ Petition has been filed challenging the impugned order dated 21.01.2016 and consequential direction to the respondent to provide information as sought by the petitioner in his application dated 15.03.2013 under the Act within the stipulated time.\\n\\n2.According to the petitioner, he has sought information under the Right to Information Act before the authority concerned but the same was not provided. Therefore, he preferred an appeal before the appellate authority wherein also the information sought by the petitioner has not been provided. Hence, he was constrained to approach the respondent to get the information by way of second appeal. But the respondent has also not properly answered the query of the petitioner. Hence, he filed a Writ Petition in WP(MD)No.5756 of 2015 to dispose of the second appeal and this Court by\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21788648/\\n\\n1\\n\\nA.Kanagaraj vs The Tamil Nadu State Information ... on 21 April, 2016\\n\\norder dated 16.04.2015 disposed of the said Writ Petition. In pursuance of the same, the respondent has disposed of the Second Appeal but he has passed the order without any application of mind and not giving final quietus to the matter and further it contained an observation not submitted by the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner has come forward with the present Writ Petition challenging the same.\\n\\n3.A perusal of the impugned order would very clearly show that in the enquiry conducted on 29.12.2015 for the non-issuance of the documents an enquiry was sought for calling upon the officers why penalty should not to be imposed in respect of one L.Murthy, erstwhile P.A. to Collector and S.Sundararaj, Special Tahsildar (Special Scheme Implementation) who is also retired. On the same day, the petitioner was also directed to be present and he has also participated in the enquiry. The very impugned order itself states that the petitioner has sought for information regarding five items from the District Collector\\'s office, Theni. But, only one item was given full information and in respect of items 2 and 3 wrong information have been given and in respect of items 4 and 5 no information was given but yet it was informed as information was given and the person who assisted the petitioner in the enquiry viz., Manikandan has specifically stated before the authority concerned that the Commissioner has no power excepting directed to issue a copy of the document. Whereas contra, the respondent has categorically stated that even as early as on 16.07.2015 the entire information as sought for by the petitioner has been given. In this connection, both the persons who have been accused against have retired on 31.03.2013 and 31.05.2013 respectively. In fact, as per the order itself, the first officer has categorically stated that when the application was received on 19.03.2013 as per Section 6(3) within five days it was referred to and sought information from the District Land Survey Department as the information sought for is in violation of Rule 7(9). When action being taken he retired on 31.03.2013. Therefore, at that point of time, he could not give the explanation sought for and for that penalty cannot be imposed was the explanation given by the then officer. The second officer also stated that since the petitioner requires documents pertaining to the third parties belonging ownership of lands and which contains huge quantity of information which could not be collected within the period of one month and also stated that he could not collect the information due to his retirement as he was also retired on 31.03.2015. Hence, he sought for not to take any action against him.\\n\\n4.The authority after considering all these factors and taking into consideration that the petitioner was also granted the information in accordance with law and his contention that the Public Information Officer be punished cannot be accepted in the explanation offered by the officers. The explanation offered was correct as they have very clearly pointed out that insofar as the first officer is concerned within the stipulated time he has initiated action to give information but in the meantime he retired. The Second officer is concerned, he was able to prove before the authority concerned that the information sought for is too much which could not be collected within the stipulated time. In any view of the matter, the authority having convinced that the information officers have not committed any offence that cannot now be challenged by the petitioner on the ground that the punishment was not imposed. In this connection, it is relevant to rely upon the decision of this Court reported in 2011 (8) SCC 492 [A.Kanagaraj vs. The Principal Commissioner and Commissioner of Land Administration, Chepauk, Chennai] wherein following the order of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court it has been clearly held that how the Right to Information Act is being\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21788648/\\n\\n2\\n\\nA.Kanagaraj vs The Tamil Nadu State Information ... on 21 April, 2016\\n\\nabused. The relevant portion in paragraph 6 of the order reads as under:\\n\\n?6. ....\\n\\n37.The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to information are intended to be formidable took in the hands of responsible citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and accountability. The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced strictly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging corruption. But in regard to other information, (that is information other than those enumerated in Section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act), equal importance and emphasis are given to other public interests (like confidentiality of sensitive information, fidelity and fiduciary relationships, efficient operation of governments, etc.,). Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counter-productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non- productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising \\'information furnishing\\', at the cost of their normal and regular duties.\\n\\nConclusion,\\n\\n38.In view of the foregoing, the order of the High Court directing the examining bodies to permit examinees to have inspection of their answer books is affirmed, subject to the clarifications regarding the scope of the RTI Act and the safeguards and conditions subject to which \\'information\\' should be furnished. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.\\n\\nTherefore, I do not find any reason to interfere with the reasoned order passed by the respondent. The Writ Petition is dismissed. No costs.\\n\\nTo The Tamil Nadu State Information Commissioner, O/o. The State Information Commission, No.2, Thiyagaraya Salai Road, Teynampet, Chennai ? 18..

(C) 3057/2012\\n\\nThe petitioner by this writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India assails the order dated 01.07.2011 passed by the Central Information Commissioner in Appeal No. CIC/DS/A/2010/002004.\\n\\nThe petitioner moved a RTI application to the Commissioner of Income Tax, ITO, Aayakar Bhawan, Sanjay Place, Agra on 03.02.2010. In this application the petitioner stated that he had moved a Tax Evasion Petition (TEP), and sought the conduct of an enquiry on the known sources of income of one Shri M. P. Singh. He stated that despite passage of seven months, he had not received any response. Therefore, under the Right to Information Act, he sought information with regard to the action taken on the said complaint.\\n\\nThis query was responded to on 09.03.2010 by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax/CPIO, Agra. The CPIO declined the application of the petitioner seeking direct information with regard to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh by placing reliance on Section 8(1)(j) on the ground that it related to a third party and disclosure of the said information was not in public interest. It appears that before disposing of the application, the CPIO also issued notice to Shri M. P. Singh and Shri M. P. Singh objected to disclosure of the information.\\n\\nThe petitioner then preferred an appeal before the first appellate authority. The first appellate authority rejected the appeal on 29/30.04.2010, again placing reliance on Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The petitioner then preferred a further appeal to the CIC, which has been disposed of by the impugned order.\\n\\nLearned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax Range-5, Forozabad has declined to act on the tax revision petition of the petitioner on the ground that the information desired by the petitioner is six years old and is barred by limitation as per the provisions of Income Tax Act. It is stated that the information is not in custody of the CPIO. He also observed that Shri M. P. Singh, against whom the complaint was lodged by the petitioner, is presently assessed with ITO 3(iv), Mathura and the jurisdiction does not lie with the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Range-5, Firozabad. He held that since no larger public interest is involved in the matter, the petitioner?s appeal is disposed of.\\n\\nThe submission of counsel for the petitioner is that since the TEP of the petitioner has not been actioned on account of the same being barred by limitation, effectively, the information sought by the petitioner has not been provided.\\n\\nLearned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the decision\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=110200&yr=2012\\n\\n2/4\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=110200&yr=2012 of this Court in W.P.(C) No. 3114/2007 in support of his submission that the respondent was neither provided information with regard to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh nor conducted an enquiry/investigation on the TEP of the petitioner.\\n\\nA perusal of the decision in Bhagat Singh vs. Chief Information Commissioner and Ors. W.P.(C) No. 3114/2007 decided on 03.12.2007 shows that in that case on the TEP action was taken, but the TEP investigation report was not provided under the Right to Information Act. All that the Court held was that the queriest was entitled to receive a copy of the said TEP investigation report. In the present case, the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax has held that the said TEP cannot be actioned as it is barred by limitation. That, in my view, is sufficient disclosure so far as the action taken on the TEP is concerned.\\n\\nSo far as the petitioner?s grievance with regard to non supply of information with regard to sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh is concerned, in my view, the CPIO correctly relied upon Section 8(1)(j) of the Act to deny information to the petitioner. Section 8(1)(j) reads as follows:-\\n\\n?8(1)(j)\\n\\ninformation which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:?\\n\\nThe information sought by the petitioner in relation to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh is undoubtedly personal information, disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest of, or in relation to, Shri M. P. Singh. I, therefore, find no merit in this petition. The same is dismissed.\\n\\nVIPIN SANGHI, J\\n\\nMAY 21, 2012\\n\\nmb\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=110200&yr=2012\\n\\n3/4\\n\\n5/22/2018 $ 36\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=110200&yr=2012\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=110200&yr=2012\\n\\n4/4\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\n%\\n\\nJudgment Reserved on: 30.08.2012 Judgment Delivered on: 09.11.2012\\n\\n+\\n\\nWP(C) 499/2012 & CM 1059/2012\\n\\nUNION OF INDIA & ORS.\\n\\n......

V.K. Shad, Respondent in person in WP(C) No. 499/2012.\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 1 of 30\\n\\nCORAM :- HON\\'BLE MR JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER\\n\\nRAJIV SHAKDHER, J\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe captioned writ petitions raises a common question of law, which\\n\\nis, whether the petitioners are obliged to furnish information to respondent\\n\\nwhich is retained with them in the record, in the form of file notings as also\\n\\nthe opinion of the Judge Advocate General (in short JAG) found in records of\\n\\nthe respondents, under the relevant provisions of the Right to Information\\n\\nAct, 2005 (in short the RTI Act).\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nIn each of the matters, the Union of India (UOI) has been represented\\n\\nby Mr Rajeeve Mehra, ASG, while the respondents have appeared in person.\\n\\nAmongst the respondents, Col. V.K. Shad has appeared in person and made\\n\\nsubmission at each date, while the same cannot be said of the other two\\n\\nrespondents, Col P.P. Singh and Brig. S. Sabharwal who have put in\\n\\nappearances occasionally. In particular, they were absent on the last two\\n\\ndates of hearing when matters were heard at length and the judgment was\\n\\nreserved in the matters. Nevertheless, it appears that, the said officers have\\n\\nadopted and are in sync, with the submissions made by Col. V.K. Shad.\\n\\n1.2 The orders impugned in each of the captured writ petitions were those\\n\\npassed by the Central Information Commission (in short CIC). In WP(C)\\n\\n499/2012, two orders are impugned. The principal order being order dated\\n\\n15.06.2011, followed by a consequential order, dated 13.12.2011.\\n\\n1.3\\n\\nIn WP(C) 1138/2012, there are, once again, two orders, which are\\n\\nimpugned. The first order impugned is, the principal order, which is, dated\\n\\n04.11.2011. This order follows the decision taken by the CIC in Col. V.K.\\n\\nShad\\'s case. The second order is dated 05.01.2012, which actually, only\\n\\nrecords, the fact that the matter had been concluded by the order dated\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 2 of 30\\n\\n4.11.2011, and that the registry of the CIC had mistakenly relisted the matter.\\n\\nThe order however, also goes on to record the fact that, a written\\n\\nrepresentation was submitted on behalf of the petitioners herein that, they be\\n\\ngiven, thirty (30) days time to comply with the order of the CIC.\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nIn the third and last writ petition being: WP(C) 1144/2012, the order\\n\\nimpugned is dated 9.6.2011.\\n\\n1.5\\n\\nIn each of these matters, the impugned orders have been passed by the\\n\\nsame Chief Information Commissioner.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThough the question of law is common, for the sake of completeness, I\\n\\npropose to briefly touch upon the relevant facts involved in each of the\\n\\nmatters, which led to institution of the instant writ petitions.\\n\\n2.1 For the sake of convenience, however, each of the respondents in their\\n\\nrespective writ petitions will be referred to by their name.\\n\\nWP(C) NO. 499/2012\\n\\n3.\\n\\nCol. V.K. Shad was posted to the Army Core Supply Battalion 5628 in\\n\\nSeptember, 2008. Evidently, he fell out with his deputy, one, Lt. Col. B.S.\\n\\nGoraya. Col. V.K. Shad had issues with regard to Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya,\\n\\nwhich in his perception impacted the functioning in the unit. Lt. Col. B.S.\\n\\nGoraya, on his part made counter allegations against Col. V.K. Shad qua\\n\\nissues which he regarded as infractions of standard operating procedures\\n\\ngoverning the functioning of the personnel inducted into the army.\\n\\n3.1 Consequently, in May, 2009, a Court of Inquiry was ordered by the\\n\\nHead Quarter, Western Command, to investigate, charges of alleged acts of\\n\\nindiscipline leveled by Col. V.K. Shad against Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya as also\\n\\ncounter charges made by Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya against Col. V.K. Shad.\\n\\n3.2 The inquiry against Col. V.K. Shad pertained to the following:\\n\\nFailure to follow laid down procedure with respect to \"(i) sale of BPL watches, as a non CSD item between October,\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 3 of 30\\n\\n2008 and March, 2009. (ii) Accepting money in Regt Fund Acct amounting to Rs 27,133/- (Rupees twenty seven thousand one hundred and thirty three only) as sponsorship from CSD Liquor Vendors between January and February 2009. (iii) Improperly passed instructions to JC-664710W Nb Sub AR Ghose of 5682 ASC Bn, JCO in-Charge AWWA Venture Shop, to not to charge the profit of 5% on the sale of fruits and vegetables to MG-IC-Adm. MG ASC and DDST of HQ Western Command.\"\\n\\n3.3 As regards, Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya (later on promoted as colonel), what\\n\\none was able to glean from the record is that, he was charged with making\\n\\nunwarranted allegations against his commanding officer Col. V.K. Shad,\\n\\nrelating to counseling letters to officers; non-payment of mess bills; and\\n\\npurchase of pickle from officer\\'s mess fund for personal use.\\n\\n3.4 The Court Of Inquiry concluded its proceedings in August, 2009. The\\n\\nopinion of the Court Of Inquiry was as follows:\\n\\n\"....(a) No case of financial misappropriation or malafide intention on part of IC-48682N Co. VK Shad, CO 5682 ASC Bn has been ascertained by the court. (b) Actions taken by Col VK Shad, CO 5682 ASC Bn in all the cases examined by the court, though at places not strictly as per laid down procedures, are on issues pertaining to routine day to day functioning of the unit and did not have any serious ramifications or resulted in any gross violation/ deviation from the accepted norms. (c) IC-46873K Lt. Col BS Goraya, 2IC, 5682 ASC Bn has apparently got into a personality clash with the CO, Vol. V.K. Shad. In the bargain, the former has attempted to polarize the Unit and in effect adversely affected the day to day functioning of the unit in gen and the CO in particular. (d) All issues which the court examined were of routine/ mundane nature and could have been resolved in the departmental channel itself. 2. The court recommends that:- (a) IC 48682N Col V K Shad, CO 5682 Bn (MT) should be suitably counselled for lapses in laid down procedures\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 4 of 30\\n\\nwith reference to the issues of \"sale of BPL Watches\", \"acceptance of sponsorship money from CSD Liquor Vendors\" and \"Functioning of AWWA Venture Shop, Chandimandir\". (b) IC-46873K Lt. Col B S Goraya, 2IC 5682 ASC Bn (MT) is recommended to be posted out of the Unit forthwith as the presence of the offr in the Bn as 2IC, is detrimental to the administrative and operational efficiency of the Bn. (c) Suitable Disciplinary/administrative action be initiated against IC-46873K Lt Col BS Goraya for leveling baseless allegations against Col VK Shad, CO on routine/ mundane issues and acting in a manner not befitting the Second in Command of the Bn by adversely affecting the functioning of the Bn.....\"\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nIt appears that the reviewing authority, which in this case was the\\n\\nCommander P.H. & H.P(1) Sub Area, differed with the opinion of the Court\\n\\nOf Inquiry, and thus, recommended, initiation of administrative and\\n\\ndisciplinary action against Col. V.K. Shad. In so far as Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya\\n\\nwas concerned,\\n\\nin addition\\n\\nto\\n\\ninitiating administrative action; a\\n\\nrecommendation was also made that, he should be posted out of the unit\\n\\nforthwith as the presence of the said officer in the battalion as the second-in-\\n\\ncommand was detrimental to the administrative and operational efficiency of\\n\\nthe Battalion.\\n\\n3.6 The matter reached the next level of command which was the General\\n\\nOfficer Commanding (GOC) Head Quarters 2 Corps (GOC-in-Chief).\\n\\n3.7 The GOC-in-Chief, while partially agreeing with the findings and\\n\\nopinion of\\n\\nthe Court Of Inquiry, noted\\n\\nthat,\\n\\nit agreed with\\n\\nrecommendations of the Commander P.H. & H.P. (1) Sub Area. In\\n\\nconclusion the GOC-in-Chief, while recommending administrative action\\n\\nagainst both Col. V.K. Shad and Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya; and concurring with\\n\\nthe view that Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya needed to be posted outside the battalion\\n\\n5682 - proceeded to convey his severe displeasure (non-recordable) to Col. WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 5 of 30\\n\\nthe\\n\\nV.K. Shad.\\n\\n3.8 This direction was issued on 10.7.2010, though after a show cause\\n\\nnotice was issued to Col. V.K. Shad on 8.4.2010, to which he was given an\\n\\nopportunity to file his defence/ reply.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIt is in this background that Col. V.K. Shad vide an application dated\\n\\n23.8.2010, took recourse to the RTI Act seeking information with regard to\\n\\nthe following:\\n\\n\"(a) Opinion and findings of the C of I convened by the convening order ref in para 1 above. (b) Recommendations on file of staff at various HQs. (c) Recommendations of Cdrs in chain of comd. (d) Directions of the GOC-in-C on the subject inquiry. (e) Copies of all letters written by Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya where he has leveled allegations against me to HQ Western Command including those written to HQ Corps and HQ PH & HP(1) Sub Area till date. I may also be info of action taken, if any, against Lt Col BS Goraya for his numerous acts of indiscipline.\"\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe PIO, vide communication dated 29.9.2010, declined to give any\\n\\ninformation. The said communication, however, did indicate that under\\n\\nArmy Rule 184 (Amended), the statement of exhibits of the Court Of Inquiry\\n\\nproceedings are made available to those persons whose character and military\\n\\nreputation is in issue in the proceedings before the Court Of Inquiry. The\\n\\nofficer was advised by the said communication to apply accordingly.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nBeing aggrieved, Col. V.K. Shad, approached the first appellate\\n\\nauthority. The first appellate authority agreed with the view taken by the PIO\\n\\nexcept, with regard to, the denial of access to letters written by Lt. Col. B.S.\\n\\nGoraya to the Head Quarters, Western Command including those written to\\n\\nHead Quarter 2 Corps and Head Quarters PH & HP (1) Sub Area. The\\n\\nrationale employed by the first appellate authority was that once investigation\\n\\nwere over, copies of letters written by Lt. Goraya uptil March, 2010 could be\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 6 of 30\\n\\nprovided to Col. V.K. Shad. In addition to the above, a further direction was\\n\\nissued, which was, to inform Col. V.K. Shad as regards the action, if any,\\n\\ninitiated, against Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nNot being satisfied, Col. V.K. Shad, approached the CIC. The CIC,\\n\\nvide order dated 15.06.2011, directed the petitioners to supply to Col. V.K.\\n\\nShad, the entire information, to the extent not supplied, within a period of\\n\\nfour weeks from the date of the order.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nSince, there was a failure, on the part of the petitioners to comply with\\n\\nthe directions of the CIC, within the time stipulated, a complaint was lodged\\n\\nby the Col. V.K. Shad, with the CIC, on 2.8.2011. Accordingly, a show\\n\\ncause notice was issued by the CIC, on 6.9.2011, to the PIO, Head Quarter\\n\\nWestern Command. The notice was made returnable on 27.9.2011.\\n\\n8.1 Vide communication dated 19.9.2011, the hearing before the CIC was\\n\\nrescheduled for 5.10.2011. By yet another notice dated 26.9.2011, the\\n\\nhearing was, once again, rescheduled for 12.10.2011.\\n\\n8.2 At the hearing held on, 12.10.2011, the CIC extended the time for\\n\\nimplementation of its order by a period of (40) days, at the request of the\\n\\nCPIO. The proceedings were posted for 1.12.2011.\\n\\n8.3 By a notice dated 29.11.2011, the said proceedings, were rescheduled\\n\\nfor 30.12.2011. On 30.12.2011, the CIC passed the second impugned order,\\n\\nin view of non-compliance of its earlier order dated 15.6.2011. By order\\n\\ndated 30.2.2011, the CIC issued a show cause notice to the then PIO, as to\\n\\nwhy, penalty of Rs 25000 should not be imposed on him under Section 20(1)\\n\\nof the RTI Act, for failure to implement its order. A show cause notice was\\n\\nalso issued to the Secretary, Government of India, Ministry of Defence, as to\\n\\nwhy compensation to the tune of Rs 50,000/- should not be awarded to Col.\\n\\nV.K.Shad, under the provisions of Section 19(8)(b) of the RTI Act, for failure\\n\\nto supply information, in compliance, with its orders. The personal WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 7 of 30\\n\\nappearance of the two named officers alongwith their written representation,\\n\\nwas also directed. The matter was posted for further proceedings, on\\n\\n7.2.2012.\\n\\n8.4\\n\\nIt is in this background that writ petition 499/2012, was moved in this\\n\\ncourt, on 24.01.2012 when, the impugned orders in so far as it directed\\n\\nprovision of the opinion of the JAG branch, was stayed.\\n\\nWP(C) No. 1138/2012\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIn this case a Court Of Inquiry was ordered by the Head Quarter\\n\\nCentral Command, to investigate circumstances in which, one (1) rifle 5.56\\n\\nmm INSAS alongwith one (1) magazine and 40 (forty) cartridges, SAS 5.56\\n\\nmm Ball INSAS, from 40 Company ASC (Sup) Type \\'D\\', was lost on the\\n\\nnight of 14/15 January, 2006 and thereafter, recovered on 18.01.2006.\\n\\n9.1 On the conclusion of the Court Of Inquiry, the proceedings, the\\n\\nfindings as also the recommendations as in the first case, were finally placed\\n\\nbefore the GOC-in-Chief, Central Command, who came to the conclusion\\n\\nthat administrative action was imperative against Col. P.P. Singh, for his\\n\\nfailure to supervise the duties which were required to be performed by his\\n\\nsubordinates and, in ensuring, the safe custody of weapons, taken on charge,\\n\\nby his unit, contrary to the provisions of para 37(c) of the Regulations For\\n\\nThe Army 1987 (Revised) and para 193 of the Military Security Instructions,\\n\\n2001.\\n\\n9.2 Based on the directions of the GOC-in-Chief, a show cause notice was\\n\\nissued to Col. P.P. Singh, on 28.10.2006. After perusing the reply of Col.\\n\\nP.P. Singh, and based on the record the GOC-in-Chief, Central Command\\n\\ndirected that his severe displeasure (Recordable) be conveyed to Col. P.P.\\n\\nSingh.\\n\\n9.3\\n\\nIt is in this background that Col. P.P. Singh also took recourse to the\\n\\nRTI Act, and sought, the following information vide his application dated WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 8 of 30\\n\\n29.1.2011:\\n\\n\"(a) Findings and opinion of the Court alongwith recommendations of the Cdrs in chain and dirn of the competent authority (GOC UB Area, GOC-in-C Central Command) on the Court Of Inquiry convened under Stn. SQs Cell, Meerut convening order no. 124901/4/G dt 21 Jan 2006. (b) Noting sheets relating to processing this case at HQ UB Area and HQ Central Command based on which GOC-in-C awarded me Severe Displeasure (Recordable). In this connection refer dirn issued HQ Central Command letter no. 190105/653/U/DV dt. 10 feb 2007. (c) Please provide copy of the authority under which this Court Of Inquiry was forwarded to HQ UB Area and further on to HQ Central Command whereas the convening authority of the Court Of Inquiry was St. HQ Cell Meerut.\"\\n\\n9.4 By communication dated 21.2.2011, the PIO rejected the application of\\n\\nCol. P.P. Singh by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the\\n\\nRTI Act.\\n\\n9.5 Being aggrieved, Col. P.P. Singh preferred an appeal with the first\\n\\nappellate authority. Interestingly, the first appellate authority while agreeing\\n\\nwith the conclusions of the PIO observed that the PIO had “correctly\\n\\ndisposed” of Col. P.P. Singh application as it fell squarely under the\\n\\nexceptions provided in Section 8(1) (g) & (h) of the RTI Act. It may be\\n\\npertinent to point out that the PIO had in fact taken recourse to provisions of\\n\\nSection 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n9.6 Col. P.P. Singh preferred an appeal with the CIC. The CIC, while\\n\\ntaking note of the fact that no proceedings were pending against Col. P.P.\\n\\nSingh, directed the release of information sought by him based on the\\n\\nreasoning provided in its order passed in Col. V.K. Shad\\'s case, though after\\n\\nredacting the names and designations of the officers, who had made notings\\n\\nin the files, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10(1) of the RTI Act.\\n\\nThe petitioners were directed to furnish the information, as directed, within WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 9 of 30\\n\\nfour (4) weeks of the order.\\n\\n9.7 As noticed above, though Col. P.P. Singh\\'s appeal before the CIC was\\n\\ndisposed on 4.5.2011, it got listed again on 5.1.2012, on which date thirty\\n\\n(30) days were sought on behalf of the petitioners, to comply with the order\\n\\nof the CIC.\\n\\nWP(C) No. 1144/2012\\n\\n10. On 5.12.2009, a Court Of Inquiry was ordered by the Head Quarters\\n\\nWestern Command\\n\\nto\\n\\ninvestigate\\n\\nthe alleged\\n\\nirregularities,\\n\\nin\\n\\nprocurement of shoes, as part of personal kit stores item for Indian troops,\\n\\nproceedings on a United Nation\\'s assignment, during the period January,\\n\\n2006 till the date of issuance of the convening order.\\n\\n10.1 The Court Of Inquiry, evidently, found Brig. S. Sabharwal guilty of\\n\\ncertain lapses alongwith four officers of the Ordinance Services Directorate,\\n\\nIntegrated Head Quarters, Ministry of Defence. Brig. S. Sabharwal\\'s conduct\\n\\nwas found blameworthy, in so far as, he had omitted to obtain formal written\\n\\nsanction of the Major General of the Ordinance prior to issuing orders to\\n\\ncarry out a major amendment vis-a-vis the scope and composition of the\\n\\nboard of officers, who were involved in the short-listing of eligible firms; and\\n\\nfor omitting to comply with instructions, which required him to nominate an\\n\\nofficer of the rank of brigadier who belonged to a Branch other than the\\n\\nOrdinance Branch, for inclusion in the price negotiation committee. It\\n\\nappears that Brig. S. Sabharwal had, contrary to the stipulated norms,\\n\\nnominated instead an officer of the rank of Major General attached to the\\n\\nOrdinance Services Directorate.\\n\\n10.2 Based on the findings of the Court Of Inquiry, a show cause notice was\\n\\nissued to Brig. S. Sabharwal, on 10.04.2010, by the Head Quarters Western\\n\\nCommand. Brig. S. Sabharwal, replied to the show cause notice vide\\n\\ncommunication dated 20.05.2010. However, by a communication dated WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 10 of 30\\n\\nthe\\n\\n14.6.2010, Brig. S. Sabharwal called upon the concerned authority to defer its\\n\\ndecision on the show cause notice, till such time it had sought clarifications\\n\\nfrom officers named in the said communication with regard to his assertion\\n\\nthat he had been issued verbal instructions with regard to the matter under\\n\\nconsideration.\\n\\n10.3 On 18.6.2010, Brig. S. Sabharwal wrote to the authority concerned that\\n\\nsince, he was one of the last witnesses summoned for cross-examination by\\n\\nthe Court Of Inquiry, he was not able to present his case effectively. In these\\n\\ncircumstances, he requested the convening authority to accord permission to\\n\\ncross-examine the witnesses in his defence, so that he could bring out the\\n\\nfacts of the case in their correct perspective.\\n\\n10.4 Evidently, a day prior to the aforesaid request, i.e., on 17.6.2010, the\\n\\nGOC-in-Chief, after considering the recommendations of the Court Of\\n\\nInquiry, the contents of the show cause notice and the reply of Brig. S.\\n\\nSabharwal, directed that his severe displeasure (recordable), be conveyed to\\n\\nBrig. S. Sabharwal.\\n\\n10.5 This resulted in Brig. S. Sabharwal approaching the PIO with an\\n\\napplication under the RTI Act. The application was preferred with the PIO,\\n\\non 3.12.2010. Brig. S. Sabharwal sought the following information:\\n\\n\"(a) All notings and correspondence of case file No. 0337/UN/PERS KIT STORES/DV2 of HQ Western Command. (b) Action taken Notings initiated by HQ Western Comd (DV) on HQ 335 Msl Bde Sig No. A-0183 dt 14 Jun 10 (Copy encl).\"\\n\\n10.6 The PIO, however, vide communication dated 10.12.2010, denied the\\n\\ninformation by relying upon the provisions of Section 8(4)(e) and (h) [sic\\n\\n8(1)(e) and (h)] of the RTI Act. It was the opinion of the PIO that, notings\\n\\nand correspondence on the subject including legal opinions generated in the\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 11 of 30\\n\\ncase could not be given to Brig. S. Sabharwal in view of a \"fiduciary\\n\\nrelationship existing in the chain of command and staff processing the\\n\\ncase\". It was also observed by the PIO that the notings and contents of the\\n\\nclassified files were exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the\\n\\nDepartment of Personnel and Training (in short DoPT) letter no. 1/20/2009-\\n\\nIR dated 23.6.2009, and that, no public interest would be served in disclosing\\n\\nthe information sought for other than the applicant\\'s own interest.\\n\\n10.7 Being aggrieved, Brig. S. Sabharwal filed an appeal with the first\\n\\nappellate authority, on 12.1.2011. The first appellate authority rejected the\\n\\nappeal, which was conveyed under the cover of the letter dated 11.2.2011.\\n\\nTo be noted, that even though, the letter dated 11.2.2011 is on record, the\\n\\norder of the first appellate authority has not been placed on record by the\\n\\npetitioners herein.\\n\\n11. Brig. S. Sabharwal, being dissatisfied with result, filed a second appeal\\n\\nwith the CIC. The CIC, passed a similar order, as was passed in the other two\\n\\ncases, whereby it directed that copy of file notings be supplied to Brig. S.\\n\\nSabharwal after redacting the names and designations of the officers, who\\n\\nmade the notings, in accordance with, the provisions of Section 10(1) of the\\n\\nRTI Act.\\n\\nSUBMISSIONS OF COUNSELS\\n\\n12.\\n\\nIn the background of the aforesaid facts, it has been argued by Mr\\n\\nMehra, learned ASG, that the CIC in several cases, contrary to the decision in\\n\\nV.K. Shad\\'s case, has taken the view that the file notings, which include legal\\n\\nopinions, need not be disclosed, as it may affect the outcome of the legal\\n\\naction instituted by the applicant/querist seeking the information. Before me,\\n\\nhowever, reference was made to the case of Col. A.B. Nargolkar vs Ministry\\n\\nof Defence passed in appeal no. CIC/LS/A/2009/000951 dated 22.9.2009.\\n\\n12.1 It was thus the submission of the learned ASG that, in the impugned WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 12 of 30\\n\\norders, a contrary view has been taken to that which was taken in Col. A.B.\\n\\nNargolkar’s case. This, he submitted was not permissible as it was a bench\\n\\nof co-equal strength. It was submitted that in case the CIC disagreed with\\n\\nthe view taken earlier, it ought to have referred the matter to a larger Bench.\\n\\n12.2 Apart from the above, Mr Mehra has submitted that, the petitioner\\'s\\n\\naction of denying information, which pertains to file notings and opinion of\\n\\nthe JAG branch is sustainable under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. It was\\n\\ncontended that there was a fiduciary relationship between the officers in the\\n\\nchain of command, and those, who were placed in the higher echelons, of\\n\\nwhat was essentially a pyramidical structure. In arriving at a final decision,\\n\\nthe GOC-in-Chief takes into account several inputs, which includes, the\\n\\nnotings on file as well as the opinion of the JAG branch. It was submitted\\n\\nthat since, the JAG branch has a duty to act and give advice on matters falling\\n\\nwithin the ambit of its mandate, the disclosure of information would result in\\n\\na breach of a fiduciary relationship qua those who give the advice and the\\n\\nfinal decision making authority, which is the recipient of the advice.\\n\\n12.3 Mr Mehra submitted that, in all three cases, the advice rendered by the\\n\\nJAG branch was taken into account both while initiating proceedings and also\\n\\nat the stage of imposition of punishment against the delinquent officers.\\n\\n12.4 Though it was not argued, in the grounds, in one of the writ petitions,\\n\\nreliance is also placed on Army Rule, 184, to contend that only the copy of\\n\\nthe statements and documents relied upon during the conduct of Court Of\\n\\nInquiry are to be provided to the delinquent officers. It is contended that the\\n\\ndirections contained in the impugned orders of the CIC, are contrary to the\\n\\nsaid Rule.\\n\\n12.5 In order to buttress his submissions reliance was placed by Mr Mehra,\\n\\non the observations of the Supreme Court, in the case of Central Board of\\n\\nSecondary Education & Ors. vs Aditya Bandopadhayay & Ors. (2011) 8 WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 13 of 30\\n\\nSCC 497. A particular stress, was laid on the observations made in\\n\\nparagraphs 38, 39, 44, 45 and 63 of the said judgment.\\n\\n13. On the other hand, the respondents in the captioned writ petitions, who\\n\\nwere led by Col. V.K. Shad, contended to the contrary and relied upon the\\n\\nimpugned orders of the CIC. Specific reliance was placed on the judgments\\n\\nof this court, in the case of, Maj. General Surender Kumar Sahni vs UOI &\\n\\nOrs in CW No. 415/2003 dated 09.04.2003 and The CPIO, Supreme Court\\n\\nof India vs Subhash Chandra Agarwal & Anr. WP(C) 288/2009\\n\\npronounced on 02.09.2009; and the judgment of the Supreme Court in the\\n\\ncase of CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhayay.\\n\\nREASONS\\n\\n14.\\n\\nI have heard the learned ASG and the respondents in the writ petitions.\\n\\nAs indicated at the very outset, the issue has been narrowed down to whether\\n\\nor not the file notings and the opinion of the JAG branch fall within the\\n\\nprovisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. I may only note, even though\\n\\nthe authorities below have fleetingly adverted to the provisions of Section\\n\\n8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, the said aspect was neither pressed nor argued before\\n\\nme, by the learned ASG. The emphasis was only qua the provisions of\\n\\nSection 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. The defence qua non-disclosure of\\n\\ninformation set up by the petitioners is thus, based on, what is perceived by\\n\\nthem as subsistence of a fiduciary relationship between officers who generate\\n\\nthe notes and the opinions which, presumably were taken in account by the\\n\\nfinal decision making authority, in coming to the conclusion which it did,\\n\\nwith regard to the guilt of the delinquent officers and the extent of\\n\\npunishment, which was accorded in each case.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nIn order to answer the issue in the present case, fortunately I am not\\n\\nrequired to, in a sense, re-invent the wheel. The Supreme Court in two recent\\n\\njudgments has dealt with the contours of what would constitute a fiduciary WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 14 of 30\\n\\nrelationship.\\n\\n15.1 Out of the two cases, the first case, was cited before me, which is\\n\\nCBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhayay and the other being ICAI vs Suaunak H.\\n\\nSatya and Ors. (2011) 8 SCC 781.\\n\\n15.2 Before I proceed further, as has been often repeated in judgment after\\n\\njudgments the preamble of the RTI Act, sets forth the guideline for\\n\\nappreciating the scope and ambit of the provisions contained in the said Act.\\n\\nThe preamble, thus envisages, a practical regime of right to information for\\n\\ncitizens, so that they have access to information which is in control of public\\n\\nauthorities with the object of promoting transparency and accountability in\\n\\nthe working of every such public authority. This right of the citizenry is\\n\\nrequired to be balanced with other public interest including efficient\\n\\noperations of the government, optimum use of limited physical resources and\\n\\nthe preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information. The idea being to\\n\\nweed out corruption, and to hold, the government and their instrumentalities\\n\\naccountable to the governed.\\n\\n15.3 The RTI Act is, thus, divided into six chapters and two schedules. For\\n\\nour purpose, what is important, is to advert to, certain provisions in chapter I,\\n\\nII and VI of the RTI Act.\\n\\n15.4 Keeping the above in mind, what is thus, required to be ascertained is:\\n\\n(i) whether the material with respect to which access is sought, is firstly,\\n\\ninformation within the meaning of the RTI Act? (ii) whether the information\\n\\nsought is from a public authority, which is amenable to the provisions of the\\n\\nRTI Act? (iii) whether the material to which access is sought (provided it is\\n\\ninformation within the meaning of the RTI Act and is in possession of an\\n\\nauthority which comes within the meaning of the term public authority) falls\\n\\nwithin the exclusionary provisions contained in Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI\\n\\nAct? WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 15 of 30\\n\\n15.5 In order to appreciate the width and scope of the aforementioned\\n\\nprovision, one would also have to bear in mind the provisions of Sections 9,\\n\\n10, 11 & 22 of the RTI Act.\\n\\n16.\\n\\nIn the present case, therefore, let me first examine whether file notings\\n\\nand opinion of the JAG branch would fall within the ambit of the provisions\\n\\nof the RTI Act.\\n\\n16.1 Section 2(f), inter alia defines information to mean “any” “material”\\n\\ncontained in any form including records, documents, memo, emails, opinions,\\n\\nadvises, press releases, circulars, orders, log books, contracts, reports, papers,\\n\\nsamples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information\\n\\nrelating to any private body, which can be, accessed by a public authority\\n\\nunder any other law for the time being in force. Section 2(i) defines record\\n\\nas one which includes - any document, manuscript and file; (ii) any microfilm\\n\\nand facsimile copy of a document; (iii) reproduction of image or images\\n\\nembodied in such microfilm; and (iv) any other material produced by a\\n\\ncomputer or any other device.\\n\\n16.2 A conjoint reading of Section 2(f) and 2(i) leaves no doubt in my mind\\n\\nthat it is an expansive definition even while it is inclusive which, brings\\n\\nwithin its ambit any material available in any form. There is an express\\n\\nreference to “opinions” and “advices”, in the definition of information under\\n\\nSection 2(f). While, the definition of record in Section 2(i) includes a “file”.\\n\\n16.3 Having regard to the above, there can be no doubt that file notings and\\n\\nopinions of the JAG branch are information, to which, a person taking\\n\\nrecourse to the RTI Act can have access provided it is available with the\\n\\nconcerned public authority.\\n\\n16.4 Section 2(h) of the RTI Act defines a public authority to mean any\\n\\nauthority or body or institution of Central Government established or\\n\\nconstituted, inter alia, by or under, the Constitution or by or under a law made WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 16 of 30\\n\\nby Parliament. There can be no doubt nor, can it be argued that the Indian\\n\\nArmy is not a public authority within the meaning of the RTI Act; which has\\n\\nthe Ministry of Defence of the Government of India as its administrative\\n\\nministry\\n\\n16.5 The scope and ambit of the right to the information to which access\\n\\nmay be had from a public authority is defined in Section 2(j). Section 2(j),\\n\\ninter alia, gives the right to information, which is accessible under this Act\\n\\nand, is held by or, is in control of the public authority by seeking inspection\\n\\nof work, documents, records by taking notes, extracts of certified copy of\\n\\ndocuments on record, by taking certified copy of material and also obtaining\\n\\ninformation in the form of discs, floppy, tapes, video cassetes, which is,\\n\\navailable in any other electronic mode, whether stored in the computer or any\\n\\nother device.\\n\\n16.6 Therefore, information which is available in the records of the Indian\\n\\nArmy and, records as indicated hereinabove includes files, is information to\\n\\nwhich the respondents are entitled to gain access. The question is: which is\\n\\nreally the heart of the matter, as to whether the information sought, in the\\n\\npresent case, falls in the exclusionary (1)(e) of Section 8 of the RTI Act.\\n\\n16.7 It may be important to note that Section 3 of the RTI Act, is an\\n\\nomnibus provision, in a sense, it mandates that all citizens shall have right to\\n\\ninformation subject to the other provisions of the RTI Act. Therefore, unless\\n\\nthe information is specifically excluded, it is required to be provided in the\\n\\nform in which it is available, unless: (i) it would disproportionately divert the\\n\\nresources of public authority or, (ii) would be detrimental to the safety and\\n\\npreservation of the record in question [See Section 7(9)] or, the provision of\\n\\ninformation sought would involve an infringement of copy right subsisting in\\n\\na person other than the State (see Section 9).\\n\\n16.8 One may also be faced with a situation where information sought is WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 17 of 30\\n\\ndovetailed with information which though falls within the exclusionary\\n\\nprovisions referred to above, is severable. In such a situation, recourse can be\\n\\ntaken to Section 10 of the RTI Act, which provides for severing that part of\\n\\nthe information which is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act, provided\\n\\nit can be “reasonably” severed from that which is not exempt. In other words,\\n\\ninformation which is not exempted but is otherwise reasonably severable, can\\n\\nbe given access to a person making a request for grant of access to the same.\\n\\n16.9 Section 11 deals with a situation where information available with a\\n\\npublic authority which relates to or has been supplied by a third party, and is\\n\\ntreated as confidential by that third party. In such an eventuality the PIO of\\n\\nthe public authority is required to give notice to such third party of the request\\n\\nreceived for disclosure of information, and thereby, invite the said third party\\n\\nto make a submission in writing or orally, whether the information should be\\n\\ndisclosed or not. In coming to a conclusion either way, the submissions\\n\\nmade by the third party, will have to be kept in mind while taking a decision\\n\\nwith regard to disclosure of information.\\n\\n17. The last Section, which is relevant for our purpose, is Section 22. The\\n\\nsaid Section conveys in no uncertain terms the width of the RTI Act. It is a\\n\\nnon-obstante clause which proclaims that the RTI Act shall prevail\\n\\nnotwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in the Official Secrets Act,\\n\\n1923 or any other law for the time being in force or, in any instrument having\\n\\neffect by virtue of any law other than the RTI Act. In other words, it\\n\\noverrides every other act or instrument having the effect of law including the\\n\\nOfficial Secrets Act, 1923.\\n\\n17.1 Thus, an over-view of the Act would show that it mandates a public\\n\\nauthority, which holds or has control over any information to disclose the\\n\\nsame to a citizen, when approached, without the citizen having to give any\\n\\nreasons for seeking a disclosure. And in pursuit of this goal, the seeker of WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 18 of 30\\n\\ninformation, apart from giving his contact details for the purposes of dispatch\\n\\nof information, is exempted from disclosing his personal details [see Section\\n\\n6(2)].\\n\\n17.2 Therefore, the rule is that, if the public authority has access to any\\n\\nmaterial, which is information, within the meaning of the RTI Act and the\\n\\nsaid information is in its possession and/or its control, the said information\\n\\nwould have to be disseminated to the information seeker, i.e., the citizen of\\n\\nthis country, without him having to give reasons or his personal details except\\n\\nto the extent relevant for transmitting the information.\\n\\n17.3 As indicated above, notes on files and opinions, to my mind, fall within\\n\\nthe ambit of the provisions of the RTI Act. The possessor of information\\n\\nbeing a public authority, i.e., the Indian Army it could only deny the\\n\\ninformation, to the seeker of information who are respondents in the present\\n\\ncase, only if the information sought falls within the exceptions provided in\\n\\nSection 8 of the RTI Act; in the instant case protection is claimed under\\n\\nclause (1)(e) of Section 8. Therefore, the argument of the petitioners that the\\n\\ninformation can be denied under Army Rule, 184 or the DoPT instructions\\n\\ndated 23.06.2009 are completely untenable in view of the over-riding effect\\n\\nof the provisions of the RTI Act. Both the Rule and the DoPT instructions\\n\\nhave to give way to the provisions of Section 22 of the RTI Act. The reason\\n\\nbeing that, they were in existence when the RTI Act was enacted by the\\n\\nParliament and the legislature is presumed to have knowledge of existing\\n\\nlegislation including subordinate legislation. The Rule and the instruction\\n\\ncan, in this case, at best have the flavour of a subordinate legislation. The\\n\\nsaid subordinate legislation cannot be taken recourse to, in my opinion to\\n\\nnullify the provisions of the RTI Act.\\n\\n17.4 Therefore, one would have to examine the provisions of Section 8(1)(e)\\n\\nof the RTI Act. The relevant parts of the said Section read as under: WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 19 of 30\\n\\n\"8. Exemption from disclosure of information – (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen - xxxx xxxx xxxx (e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information. xxxx xxxx Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. (2) Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923) nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-section (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. (3) x x x x x Provided that where any question arises as to the date from which the said period of twenty years has to be computed, the decision of the Central Government shall be final, subject to the usual appeals provided for in this Act.\"\\n\\n17.5 In CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhyay case, the Supreme Court was called\\n\\nupon to decide the issue as to whether, an examinee was entitled to an\\n\\ninspection of his answer books, in view of the appellant before the Supreme\\n\\nCourt, i.e., the CBSE, claiming exemption under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI\\n\\nAct.\\n\\n17.6 In this context, the court considered the issue: whether the examining\\n\\nbody holds the evaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship with the\\n\\nexaminers.\\n\\n17.7 The Supreme Court after noting various meanings ascribed to the term\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 20 of 30\\n\\n“fiduciary” in various dictionaries and texts, summed up what the term\\n\\nfiduciary would mean, in the following paragraph of its judgment:\\n\\n“……39. The term \\'fiduciary\\' refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term \\'fiduciary relationship\\' is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or transaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party….”\\n\\n17.8\\n\\nExamples of certain relationships, where both parties act in a fiduciary\\n\\ncapacity, while treating the other as beneficiary, are set out in paragraph 40\\n\\nand 41 of the judgment. In paragraph 41 onwards the Court examined what\\n\\nwould be the true scope of the expression \"information available to a person\\n\\nin his capacity as fiduciary relationship\", as used in Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI\\n\\nAct. In that context several fiduciary relationships were referred to like the\\n\\none between a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust; a guardian with reference\\n\\nto a minor or, a physically infirm or mentally incapacitated person; a parent\\n\\nwith reference to a child; a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to\\n\\na client etc. After considering the matter at length, the Supreme Court came\\n\\nto the conclusion that there was no fiduciary relationship between the\\n\\nexamining body and the examiner with reference to evaluated answer books.\\n\\nThe court also examined the issue that if one were to assume that there was a\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 21 of 30\\n\\nfiduciary relationship between the examiner and the examining body, whether\\n\\nthe exemption would operate vis-a-vis third parties. In paragraph 44 of the\\n\\njudgment, the court concluded that if there was a fiduciary relationship, the\\n\\nexemption would operate vis-a-vis a third party, however, there would be no\\n\\nquestion of withholding information relating to the beneficiary from the\\n\\nbeneficiary himself.\\n\\n17.9 In paragraphs 49 and 50, the court concluded that since the examiner is\\n\\nacting as an agent of the examining body, in principle, the examining body is\\n\\nnot in the position of a fiduciary, with reference to the examiner. On the\\n\\nother hand, once the examiner hands over the custody of the evaluated answer\\n\\nbooks, whose contents he is barred from disclosing as he acts as a fiduciary,\\n\\nuptill that point of time, ceases to be in that relationship once the work of\\n\\nevaluation of answer books is concluded, and the evaluated answer sheets are\\n\\nhanded over to the examining body. In other words, since the examiner does\\n\\nnot have any copyright or proprietary right or a right of confidentiality, in the\\n\\nevaluated answer books, the examining body cannot be said to be holding the\\n\\nevaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship qua the examiner.\\n\\n18. A similar view was held by the same Bench of the Supreme Court in\\n\\nthe case of ICAI vs Shaunak H. Satya. The Supreme Court, while dealing\\n\\nwith the issue whether the instructions and solutions to questions are\\n\\ninformation available to examiner and moderators in their fiduciary capacity,\\n\\nand therefore, exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act, made the\\n\\nfollowing observations in paragraph 22 of the judgment:\\n\\n\"....22. It should be noted that Section 8(1)(e) uses the words \"information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship. Significantly Section 8(1)(e) does not use the words \"information available to a public authority in its fiduciary relationship\". The use of the words \"person\" shows that the holder of the information in a fiduciary relationship need not only be a \\'public authority\\' as the\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 22 of 30\\n\\nword \\'person\\' is of much wider import than the word \\'public authority\\'. Therefore the exemption under Section 8(1)(e) is available not only in regard to information that is held by a public authority (in this case the examining body) in a fiduciary capacity, but also to any information that is given or made available by a public authority to anyone else for being held in a fiduciary relationship. In other words, anything given and taken in confidence to be maintained will be expecting confidentiality information available fiduciary relationship. As a consequence, it has to be held that the instructions and solutions to questions communicated by the examining body to the examiners, head-examiners and moderators, are information available to such persons in their fiduciary relationship and therefore exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(d) of RTI Act....\"\\n\\nto a person\\n\\nin\\n\\n19. The court also made clear in paragraph 26 of the judgment that there\\n\\nwere ten categories of information which were exempt from Section 8 of the\\n\\nRTI Act. Out of the ten categories, six categories enjoyed absolute\\n\\nexemption. These being: those information, which fell in clauses (a), (b), (c),\\n\\n(f), (g) & (h) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, while information enumerated in\\n\\nclauses (d), (e) & (j) of the very same Section enjoyed “conditional”\\n\\nexemption to the extent that the information was subject to over-riding power\\n\\nof the competent authority under the RTI Act in larger public interest, which\\n\\ncould in a given case, direct disclosure of such information. Clause (i), the\\n\\nSupreme Court noted, was period specific in as much as under Sub-Section\\n\\n(3) such information could be provided if the event or matter in issue had\\n\\noccurred 20 years prior to the date of the request being made under Section 6\\n\\nof the RTI Act. It inter alia concluded, that, information relating to fiduciary\\n\\nrelationship under clause 8(1)(e) did not enjoy absolute exemption.\\n\\n20. Before I proceed further, I may also note that the first proviso in\\n\\nSection 8 says that, information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or\\n\\nthe State Legislature, shall not be denied to any person. Subsection (2) of WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 23 of 30\\n\\nSection 8, states that notwithstanding anything contained in the Official\\n\\nSecret Acts, 1923, or any of the exemptions provided in Subsection (1),\\n\\nwould not come in the way of a public authority in allowing access to\\n\\ninformation if, public interest in its disclosure outweighs the harm to the\\n\\nprotected interest.\\n\\n20.1 A Full Bench of this court in the case of Secretary General, Supreme\\n\\nCourt of India Vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, 166 (2010) DLT 305, in the\\n\\ncontext of provisions of Section 8(1)(j) also examined what would constitute\\n\\na fiduciary relationship. The observations contained in paragraph 97 to 101,\\n\\nbeing apposite are extracted hereinbelow:\\n\\n\".....97. As Waker defines it: \"A \"fiduciary\" is a person in a position of trust, or occupying a position of power and confidence with respect to another such that he is obliged by various rules of law to act solely in the interest of the other, whose rights he has to protect. He may not make any profit or advantage from the relationship without full disclosure. The category includes trustees, Company promoters and directors, guardians, solicitors and clients and other similarly placed.\" [Oxford Companion to Law, 1980 p.469]\\n\\nrelationship\", as observed by 98. \"A Anantnarayanan, J., \"may arise in the context of a jural relationship. Where confidence is reposed by one in another and that leads to a transaction in which there is a conflict of interest and duty in the person in whom such confidence relationship immediately springs into existence.\" [see Mrs. Nellie Wapshare v. Pierce Lasha & Co. Ltd. AIR 1960 Mad 410]\\n\\nfiduciary\\n\\nis\\n\\nreposed,\\n\\nfiduciary\\n\\n99. In Lyell v. Kennedy (1889) 14 AC 437, the Court explained that whenever two persons stand in such a situation that confidence is necessarily reposed by one in the other, there arises a presumption as to fiduciary that relationship which grows naturally out of Page 24 of 30\\n\\n99. In Lyell v. Kennedy (1889) 14 AC 437, the Court explained that whenever two persons stand in such a situation that confidence is necessarily reposed by one in the other, there arises a presumption as to fiduciary that relationship which grows naturally out of Page 24 of 30\\n\\nconfidence. Such a confidential situation may arise from a contract or by some gratuitous undertaking, or it may be upon previous request or undertaken without any authority.\\n\\n100. In Dale & Carrington Invt. (P) Ltd. v. P.K. Prathaphan: (2005) 1 SCC 212 and Needle Industries (India) Ltd. v. Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. (1981) 3 SCC 333, the Court held that the directors of the company owe fiduciary duty to its shareholders. In P.V. Sankara Kurup v. Leelavathy Nambier: (1994) 6 SCC 68, the Court held that an agent and power of attorney can be said to owe a fiduciary relationship to the principal.\\n\\n101. Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act requires a fiduciary not to gain an advantage of his position. Section 88 applies to a trustee, executor, partner, agent, director of a company, legal advisor or other persons bound in fiduciary capacity. Kinds of persons bound by fiduciary character are enumerated in Mr. M. Gandhi\\'s book on \"Equity, Trusts and Specific Relief\" (2nd ed., Eastern Book Company) (1) Trustee, (2) Director of a company, (3) Partner, (4) Agent, (5) Executor, (6) Legal Adviser, (7) Manager of a joint family, (8) Parent and child, (9) Religious, medical and other advisers, (10) Guardian and Ward, (11) Licensees appointed on remuneration to purchase stocks on behalf of government, (12) Confidential Transactions wherein confidence is indicated by (a) Undue reposed, and which are influence, (b) Control over property, (c) Cases of unjust enrichment, (e) Commitment of job, (13) Tenant for life,\\n\\n(d) Confidential\\n\\ninformation,\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 25 of 30\\n\\n(14) Co-owner, (15) Mortgagee, (16) Other qualified owners of property, (17) De facto guardian, (18) Receiver, (19) Insurance Company, (20) Trustee de son tort, (21) Co-heir, (22) Benamidar.\\n\\n20.2 The above would show that there are two kinds of relationships. One,\\n\\nwhere a fiducial relationship exists, which is applicable to legal relationships\\n\\nbetween parties, such as guardian and ward, administrator and heirs,\\n\\nexecutors and beneficiaries of a testamentary succession; while the other\\n\\nsprings from a confidential relationship which is pivoted on confidence. In\\n\\nother words confidence is reposed and exercised. Thus, the term fiduciary\\n\\napplies, it appears, to a person who enjoys peculiar confidence qua other\\n\\npersons. The relationship mandates fair dealing and good faith, not\\n\\nnecessarily borne out of a legal obligation. It also permeates to transactions,\\n\\nwhich are informal in nature. [See words and phrases Permanent Edn. (Vol.\\n\\n16-A, p. 41) and para 38.3 of the CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhyay]. As\\n\\nindicated above, the Supreme Court in the very same judgment in paragraph\\n\\n39 has summed up as to what the term fiduciary would mean.\\n\\n20.3 In the instant case, what is sought to be argued in sum and substance\\n\\nthat, it is a fiducial relation of the latter kind, where the persons generating\\n\\nthe note or opinion expects the fiduciary, i.e., the institution, which is the\\n\\nArmy, to hold their trust and confidence and not disclose the information to\\n\\nthe respondents herein, i.e., Messers V.K. Shad and Ors. If this argument\\n\\nwere to be accepted, then the persons, who generate the notes in the file or the\\n\\nopinions, would have to be, in one sense, the beneficiaries of the said\\n\\ninformation. In an institutional set up, it can hardly be argued that notes on\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 26 of 30\\n\\nfile qua a personnel or an employee of an institution, such as the Army,\\n\\nwhether vis-a-vis his performance or his conduct, in any manner, can benefit\\n\\nthe person, who generates the note or renders an opinion. As a matter of fact,\\n\\nthe person who generates the note or renders an opinion is presumed to be a\\n\\nperson who is objective and not conflicted by virtue of his interest in the\\n\\nmatter, on which, he is called upon to deliberate. If that position holds, then\\n\\nit can neither be argued nor can it be conceived that notes on file or opinions\\n\\nrendered in an institutional setup by one officer qua the working or conduct\\n\\nof another officer brings forth a fiduciary relationship. It is also not a\\n\\nrelationship of the kind where both parties required the other to act in a\\n\\nfiduciary capacity by treating the other as a beneficiary. The examples of\\n\\nsuch situations are found say in a partnership firm where, each partner acts in\\n\\nfiduciary capacity qua the other partner(s).\\n\\n20.4 If at all, a fiduciary relationship springs up in such like situation, it\\n\\nwould be when a third party seeks information qua the performance or\\n\\nconduct of an employee. The institution, in such a case, which holds the\\n\\ninformation, would then have to determine as to whether such information\\n\\nought to be revealed keeping in mind the competing public interest. If public\\n\\ninterest so demands, information, even in such a situation, would have to be\\n\\ndisclosed, though after taking into account the rights of the individual\\n\\nconcerned to whom the information pertains. A denial of access to such\\n\\ninformation to the information seekers, i.e., the respondents herein, (Messers\\n\\nV.K. Shad & Co.) especially in the circumstances that the said information is\\n\\nused admittedly in coming to the conclusion that the delinquent officers were\\n\\nguilty, and in determining the punishment to be accorded to them, would\\n\\ninvolve a serious breach of principles of natural\\n\\njustice, as non-\\n\\ncommunication would entail civil consequences and would render such a\\n\\ndecision vulnerable to challenge under Article 14 of the Constitution of India WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 27 of 30\\n\\nprovided information is sought and was not given. [See UOI vs R.S. Khan\\n\\n173 (2010) DLT 680].\\n\\n21.\\n\\nIt is trite law that the right to information is a constitutional right under\\n\\nArticle 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India which, with the enactment of the\\n\\nRTI Act has been given in addition a statutory flavour with the exceptions\\n\\nprovided therein. But for the exceptions given in the RTI Act; the said\\n\\nstatute recognizes the right of a citizen to seek access to any material which is\\n\\nheld or is in possession of public authority.\\n\\n22. This brings me to the first proviso of Section 8(1), which categorically\\n\\nstates that no information will be denied to any person, which cannot be\\n\\ndenied to the Parliament or the State Legislature. Similarly, sub-section (2)\\n\\nof Section 8, empowers the public authority to over-ride the Official Secrets\\n\\nAct, 1923 and, the exemptions contained in sub-section (1) of Section 8, of\\n\\nthe RTI Act, if public interest in the disclosure of information outweighs the\\n\\nharm to the protected interest. As indicated hereinabove, the Supreme Court\\n\\nin CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhayay case has clearly observed that exemption\\n\\nunder Section 8(1)(e) is conditional and not an absolute exemption.\\n\\n23\\n\\nI may only add a note of caution here: which is, that protection\\n\\nafforded to a client vis-à-vis his legal advises under the provisions of Section\\n\\n126 to 129 of the Evidence Act, 1872 is not to be confused with the present\\n\\nsituation. The protection under the said provisions is accorded to a client with\\n\\nrespect to his communication with his legal advisor made in confidence in the\\n\\ncourse of and for the purpose of his employment unless the client consents to\\n\\nits disclosure or, it is a communication made in furtherance of any illegal\\n\\npurpose. The institution i.e The Indian Army in the present case cannot by\\n\\nany stretch of imagination be categorized as a client. The legal professional\\n\\nprivilege extends only to a barrister, pleader, attorney or Vakil. The persons\\n\\nwho have generated opinions and/or the notings on the file in the present case WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 28 of 30\\n\\ndo not fall in any of these categories.\\n\\n23.1 Having regard to the above, I am of the view that the contentions of the\\n\\npetitioners that the information sought by the respondents (Messers V.K.\\n\\nShad & Co.) under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act is exempt from disclosure, is a\\n\\ncontention, which is misconceived and untenable. For instance, can the\\n\\ninformation in issue in the present case, denied to the Parliament and State\\n\\nLegislature. In my view it cannot be denied, therefore, the necessary\\n\\nconsequences of providing information to Messers V.K. Shad should follow.\\n\\n24. The argument of the learned ASG that, the CIC had taken a\\n\\ndiametrically opposite view in the other cases and hence the CIC ought to\\n\\nhave referred the matter to a larger bench, does have weight. This objection\\n\\nordinarily may have weighed with me but for the following reasons :-\\n\\n24.1 First, the judgment of the CIC cited for this purpose i.e., Col. A.B.\\n\\nNargolkar case, dealt with the situation where an order of remand was passed\\n\\ndirecting the PIO to apply the ratio of the judgment of a Single Judge of this\\n\\ncourt in the case of the CPIO, Supreme Court of India Vs. Subhash\\n\\nChandra Agarwal and Anr., WP (C) 288/2009, pronounced on 02.09.2009.\\n\\nThe CIC by itself did render a definite view.\\n\\n24.2 Second, keeping in mind the fact that the information commissioners\\n\\nadministering the RTI Act are neither persons who are necessarily instructed\\n\\nin law, i.e., are not trained lawyers, and nor did they have the benefit of such\\n\\nguidance at the stage of argument, I do not think it would be appropriate to\\n\\nset aside the impugned judgment on this ground and remand the matter for a\\n\\nfresh consideration by a larger bench of the CIC. This view, I am inclined to\\n\\nhold also, on account of the fact that, since then there have been several\\n\\nrulings of various High Courts including that of the Supreme Court, to which\\n\\nI have made a reference above, and that, remanding the matter to the CIC\\n\\nwould only delay the cause of the parties before me. WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 29 of 30\\n\\n24.3 These are cases which affect the interest of both parties, especially the\\n\\npetitioners in a large number of cases, and therefore, the need for a ruling of a\\n\\nsuperior court one way or the other, on the issue. It is in this context that I\\n\\nhad proceeded to decide the matter on merits, and not take the route of\\n\\nremand in this particular case. The CIC is, however, advised in future to have\\n\\nregard to the discipline of referring the matters to a larger bench where a\\n\\nbench of co-ordinate strength takes a view which is not consistent with the\\n\\nview of the other.\\n\\n25. For the foregoing reasons, the writ petitions are dismissed. The\\n\\nimpugned orders passed by the CIC are sustained. The information sought by\\n\\nMessers V.K. Shad and Ors will be supplied within two weeks from today, in\\n\\nterms of the orders passed by the CIC. However, having regard to the\\n\\npeculiar facts and circumstances of the case, parties are directed to bear their\\n\\nown costs save and except to the extent that the sum of Rs 5000/- each,\\n\\ndeposited pursuant to the two orders of my predecessor of even date, passed\\n\\non 27.02.2012, in WP(C) Nos. 1144/2012 and 1138/2012, shall be released,\\n\\non a pro rata basis, to the three respondents, towards incidental expenses.\\n\\nRAJIV SHAKDHER, J\\n\\nNOVEMBER 09, 2012 kk\\n\\nWP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/2012\\n\\nPage 30 of 30\\n\\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\n%\\n\\nDate of decision: 28th May, 2012\\n\\n+\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011\\n\\nALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES .....

The said writ petition was preferred impugning\\n\\nthe decision dated 12th November, 2010 of the Central Information\\n\\nCommission (CIC) directing the appellant to furnish to the respondent the\\n\\ninformation sought by the respondent. Notice of this appeal and of the\\n\\napplication for condonation of 106 days delay in filing this appeal was\\n\\nissued vide order dated 26th May, 2011 and the operation of the order dated\\n\\n22nd December, 2010 of the learned Single Judge was also stayed. The\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 1 of 19\\n\\nrespondent remained unserved with the report that “a lady at the address of\\n\\nthe respondent refused to accept the notice on the ground that the respondent\\n\\nwas working at “Jabwa” and she had no knowledge of the notice”. The\\n\\nrespondent was directed to be served afresh but no steps were taken by the\\n\\nappellant. When the matter came up before us on 1st March, 2012, being of\\n\\nthe view that the matter was fully covered by the judgment of the Supreme\\n\\nCourt in The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Shaunak H.\\n\\nSatya (2011) 8 SCC 781, the counsel for the appellant was asked to satisfy\\n\\nthis Court as to the merit of this appeal. The counsel for the appellant\\n\\nsought adjournment from time to time and in these circumstances on 30th\\n\\nMarch, 2012 orders were reserved in the appeal with liberty to the counsel\\n\\nfor the appellant to file written arguments. Written arguments dated 11th\\n\\nApril, 2012 have been filed by the appellant and which have been considered\\n\\nby us.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe respondent in his application dated 5th April, 2010 had sought the\\n\\nfollowing information from the Information Officer of the appellant.\\n\\n“1.\\n\\nCertified copies of original questions papers of all Mch super-\\n\\nspeciality entrance exam conducted from 2005-2010.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 2 of 19\\n\\n2.\\n\\nCertified copies of correct answers of all respective questions\\n\\nasked in Mch super-speciality entrance exam conducted from\\n\\n2005-2010.”\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe Information Officer of the appellant vide reply dated 21st April,\\n\\n2010 refused to supply the information sought on the ground that the\\n\\n“questions and their answers are prepared and edited by AIIMS, thus the\\n\\nproduct remains „intellectual property‟ of AIIMS. Since these questions are\\n\\npart of the question bank and likely to be used again, the supply of question\\n\\nbooklet would be against larger public interest”. The provisions of Section 8\\n\\n(1) (d) and 8(1) (e) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 were also invoked.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe respondent preferred an appeal to the First Appellate Authority.\\n\\nThe First Appellate Authority sought the comments of the appellant AIIMS.\\n\\nAIIMS, besides reiterating what was replied by its Information Officer\\n\\nadded that the information asked was a part of confidential documents which\\n\\ncompromises the process of selection and thus could not be disclosed.\\n\\nThough the order of the First Appellate Authority is not found in the paper\\n\\nbook, but it appears that the appeal was dismissed as the respondent\\n\\npreferred a second appeal to the CIC.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 3 of 19\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIt was the contention of the appellant before the CIC that there are\\n\\nlimited number of questions available with regard to super-speciality\\n\\nsubjects in the question bank and that the disclosure of such questions would\\n\\nonly encourage the students appearing for the exam to simply memorize the\\n\\nanswers for the exam, thereby adversely affecting the selection of good\\n\\ncandidates for super-speciality courses. It was thus argued that the question\\n\\npapers of the entrance examination for super-speciality courses could not be\\n\\nmade public.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nCIC vide its order dated 12th November, 2010 (supra), noticing the\\n\\nadmission of the appellant that the question papers could not be termed as\\n\\n„intellectual property‟ and observing that the appellant had been unable to\\n\\ninvoke any exemption sub-clause of Section 8(1) of the Act to deny\\n\\ninformation and further holding that the refusal of information was not\\n\\ntenable under the Act, allowed the appeal of the respondent and directed the\\n\\nappellant to provide complete information to the respondent.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe learned Single Judge, as aforesaid dismissed the writ petition of\\n\\nthe appellant challenging the aforesaid order of CIC in limine observing that\\n\\nthe appellant had not been able to show how the disclosure of the entrance\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 4 of 19\\n\\nexam question papers would adversely affect the competitive position of any\\n\\nthird party and thus Section 8(1)(d) was not attracted. It was further\\n\\nobserved that there was no fiduciary relationship between the experts who\\n\\nhelped to develop the question bank and the appellant and thus Section 8(1)\\n\\n(e) also could not be attracted.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe appellant in its written submissions before us urges:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nthat the subject matter of this appeal is not covered by the\\n\\njudgment of the Supreme Court in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) as\\n\\nthe facts and circumstances are completely different;\\n\\nii.\\n\\nthat the entrance examination for super-speciality courses was\\n\\nintroduced by the appellant only in the year 2005;\\n\\niii.\\n\\nthat at the level of super-speciality examinations, there can be\\n\\nvery limited questions, which are developed gradually; that\\n\\nsuch question papers are not in public domain; that a\\n\\ndeclaration is also taken from the examinee appearing in the\\n\\nsaid examination that they will not copy the questions from the\\n\\nquestion papers or carry the same;\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 5 of 19\\n\\niv. per contra, in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) the Institute of\\n\\nChartered Accountants (ICA) was voluntarily publishing the\\n\\nsuggested answers of the question papers in the form of a paper\\n\\nbook and offering it for sale every year after examination and it\\n\\nwas owing to the said peculiar fact that it was held that\\n\\ndisclosure thereof would not harm the competitive position of\\n\\nany third party;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nthat the information seeker in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) was a\\n\\ncandidate who had failed in examination and who was raising a\\n\\nquestion of corruption and accountability in the checking of\\n\\nquestion papers; per contra the respondent herein is neither a\\n\\ncandidate nor has appeared in any of the super-speciality\\n\\ncourses examination conducted by the appellant;\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nthat the appellant consults the subject experts, designs the\\n\\nquestion papers and takes model answers in respect of each\\n\\nquestion papers; such question papers prepared by experts in a\\n\\nparticular manner for the appellant are original literary work\\n\\nand copyright in respect thereof vests in the appellant;\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 6 of 19\\n\\nvii\\n\\nthat the examinees taking the said examination are informed by\\n\\na stipulation to the said effect on the admit card itself that civil\\n\\nand criminal proceedings will be instituted if found taking or\\n\\nattempting to take any part of the question booklets;\\n\\nviii. that copyright of appellant is protected under Section 8(1)(d);\\n\\nix.\\n\\nthat Section 9 of the Act also requires the Information Officer\\n\\nto reject a request for information, access whereto would\\n\\ninvolve an infringement of copyright subsisting in a person\\n\\nother than a State;\\n\\nx.\\n\\nthat the appellant also gives a declaration to the paper setters to\\n\\nprotect their literary work - reliance in this regard is placed on\\n\\nSection 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957;\\n\\nxi.\\n\\nthat at the stage of super-speciality, there can be very limited\\n\\nquestions which can be framed and if the question papers of all\\n\\nthe examinations conducted from 2005-2010 are disclosed, then\\n\\nall possible questions which can be asked would be in public\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 7 of 19\\n\\ndomain and that would affect the competitive position of\\n\\nstudents taking the examinations.\\n\\n9. We have minutely considered the judgment of the Apex Court in\\n\\nShaunak H. Satya (supra) in the light of the contentions aforesaid of the\\n\\nappellant and find -\\n\\ni.\\n\\nthat the information seeker therein was an unsuccessful examinee\\n\\nof the examination qua which information was sought;\\n\\nii.\\n\\nthat the ICA had pleaded confidentiality and invoked Section\\n\\n8(1)(e) of the Act for denying the information as to “number of\\n\\ntimes the marks of any candidate or class of candidates had been\\n\\nrevised, the criteria used for the same, the quantum of such\\n\\nrevision and the authority which exercised the said power to revise\\n\\nthe marks”;\\n\\nii.\\n\\nthat the CIC in that case had upheld the order refusing disclosure\\n\\nobserving that the disclosure would seriously and irretrievably\\n\\ncompromise the entire examination process and the instructions\\n\\nissued by the Examination Conducting Public Authority to its\\n\\nexaminers are strictly confidential;\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 8 of 19\\n\\niii.\\n\\nit was also observed that the book annually prepared and sold by\\n\\nthe ICA was providing „solutions‟ to the questions and not „model\\n\\nanswers‟;\\n\\niv. however the High Court in that case had directed disclosure for the\\n\\nreason of the suggested answers being published and sold in open\\n\\nmarket by the ICA itself and there being thus no confidentiality\\n\\nwith respect thereto. It was also held that the confidentiality\\n\\ndisappeared when the result of the examination was declared.\\n\\n10. The Supreme Court, on the aforesaid finding, held-\\n\\ni.\\n\\nthat though the question papers were intellectual property of\\n\\nthe ICA but the exemption under Section 8(1)(d) is available\\n\\nonly in regard to intellectual property disclosure of which\\n\\nwould harm the competitive position of any third party;\\n\\nii.\\n\\nthat what may be exempted from disclosure at one point of\\n\\ntime may cease to be exempted at a later point of time;\\n\\niii.\\n\\nthat though the question papers and the solutions/model\\n\\nanswers and instructions cannot be disclosed before the\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 9 of 19\\n\\nexamination but the disclosure, after the examination is held\\n\\nwould not harm the competitive position of any third party\\n\\ninasmuch as the question paper is disclosed „to everyone‟ at\\n\\nthe time of examination and the ICA was itself publishing the\\n\\nsuggested answers in the form of a book for sale every year,\\n\\nafter the examination;\\n\\niv.\\n\\nthe word “State” used in Section 9 of the Act refers to the\\n\\nCentral Government or the State Government, Parliament or\\n\\nLegislature of a State or any local or other authority as\\n\\ndescribed under Gazette of the Constitution;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nuse of the expression “State” instead of “public authority”\\n\\nshowed\\n\\nthat State\\n\\nincludes\\n\\neven\\n\\nnon-government\\n\\norganizations financed directly or\\n\\nindirectly by funds\\n\\nprovided by the appropriate Government;\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nICA being a „State‟ was not entitled to claim protection\\n\\nagainst disclosure under Section 9.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 10 of 19\\n\\nvii.\\n\\nfurnishing of information by an examining body, in response\\n\\nto a query under RTI Act, may not be termed as an\\n\\ninfringement of copyright. The instructions and solutions to\\n\\nquestions communicated by the examining body to the\\n\\nexaminers, head examiners and moderators are information\\n\\navailable to such persons in their fiduciary relationship and\\n\\ntherefore exempted from disclosure under section 8(1)(d) of\\n\\nthe Act and there is no larger public interest requiring denial\\n\\nof the statutory exemption regarding such information;\\n\\nviii.\\n\\nthe competent authorities under the RTI Act have to maintain\\n\\na proper balance so that while achieving transparency, the\\n\\ndemand for\\n\\ninformation does not reach unmanageable\\n\\nproportions affecting other public interests, which include\\n\\nefficient operation of public authorities and government,\\n\\npreservation of confidentiality of sensitive information and\\n\\noptimum use of limited fiscal resources.\\n\\n11. The dissection aforesaid of the judgment Shaunak H. Satya in the\\n\\nlight of the arguments of the appellant noted above does show that the\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 11 of 19\\n\\nlearned Single Judge has not dealt therewith. We have satisfied ourselves\\n\\nfrom perusal of the writ record that, at least in the writ petition, the same\\n\\ngrounds were taken, whether orally urged or not. The same do require\\n\\nconsideration and we do not at this stage deem it appropriate to remand the\\n\\nmatter to the Single Judge.\\n\\n12. We are conscious that though notice of this appeal was issued to the\\n\\nrespondent but the respondent remains unserved. We have wondered\\n\\nwhether to again list this appeal for service of the respondent, to consider the\\n\\naforesaid arguments of the appellant and the response if any of the\\n\\nrespondent thereto but have decided against the said course, finding the\\n\\nrespondent to be a resident of Indore, having participated in the hearing\\n\\nbefore the CIC also through audio conferencing and also for the reason that\\n\\ninspite of the order of the learned Single Judge having remained stayed for\\n\\nthe last nearly two years, the respondent has not made any effort to join\\n\\nthese proceedings. We have in the circumstances opted to decipher the\\n\\ncontentions of the respondent from the memoranda of the first and the\\n\\nsecond appeals on record and from his contention in the audio conferencing,\\n\\nas recorded in the order of the CIC.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 12 of 19\\n\\n13. The respondent in the memorandum of first appeal, while admitting\\n\\nthe question papers and model answers to be intellectual property of\\n\\nappellant, had pleaded that publication thereof was in larger public interest\\n\\nas the aspiring students would be able to prepare and understand the pattern\\n\\nof questions asked in super-speciality entrance examination in future. It was\\n\\nalso pleaded that question papers of most of the other examinations held\\n\\nwere available to the students and generally only 10-20% of the questions\\n\\nwere repeated. It was also his case that with the galloping advancement in\\n\\nmedical science, the average student is not able to understand what to study\\n\\nand follow and preparation for the examination would be facilitated for the\\n\\nprospective examinees if the question papers are made public. In the\\n\\nmemorandum of the second appeal it was also pleaded that when the best\\n\\nfaculty was available to the appellant, if did not need to depend on old\\n\\nquestion papers. During the hearing via audio conferencing before the CIC,\\n\\nthe respondent had contended that the question papers could not be termed\\n\\nas intellectual property and it was in larger public interest to provide the\\n\\nquestions to the aspiring students who will be able to understand the pattern\\n\\nin which the questions are framed.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 13 of 19\\n\\n14. We tend to agree with the counsel for the appellant that the judgment\\n\\nof the Apex Court in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) cannot be blindly applied to\\n\\nthe facts of the present case. The judgment of the Apex Court was in the\\n\\nbackdrop of the question papers in that case being available to the examinees\\n\\nduring the examination and being also sold together with suggested answers\\n\\nafter the examination. Per contra in the present case, the question papers\\n\\ncomprises only of multiple choice questions and are such which cannot be\\n\\ncarried out from the examination hall by the examinees and in which\\n\\nexamination there is an express prohibition against copying or carrying out\\n\\nof the question papers. Thus the reasoning given by the Supreme Court does\\n\\nnot apply to the facts of the present case.\\n\\n15. We are satisfied that the nature of the examination, subject matter of\\n\\nthis appeal, is materially different from the examination considered by the\\n\\nSupreme Court in the judgment supra. There are few seats, often limited to\\n\\none only, in such super-speciality courses and the examinees are highly\\n\\nqualified, post graduates in the field of medicine. Though the respondent, as\\n\\naforesaid, has paid tributes to the faculty of the appellant and credited them\\n\\nwith the ingenuity to churn out now questions year after year but we cannot\\n\\nignore the statement in the memorandum of this appeal supported by the\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 14 of 19\\n\\naffidavit of the Sub-Dean (Examinations) of the appellant to the effect that\\n\\nthe number of multiple choice questions which can be framed for a\\n\\ncompetitive examination for admission to a super-speciality course dealing\\n\\nwith one organ only of the human body, are limited. This plea is duly\\n\\nsupported by the prohibition on the examinees from copying or carrying out\\n\\nfrom the examination hall the question papers or any part thereof. We have\\n\\nno reason to reject such expert view.\\n\\n16. The Sub-Dean of Examinations of the appellant in the Memorandum\\n\\nof this appeal has further pleaded that if question papers are so disclosed, the\\n\\npossibility of the examination not resulting in the selection of the best\\n\\ncandidate cannot be ruled out. It is pleaded that knowledge of the question\\n\\npapers of all the previous years with correct answers may lead to selection of\\n\\na student with good memory rather than an analytical mind. It is also\\n\\npleaded that setting up of such question papers besides intellectual efforts\\n\\nalso entails expenditure. The possibility of appellant, in a given year cutting\\n\\nthe said expenditure by picking up questions from its question bank is thus\\n\\nplausible and which factor was considered by the Supreme Court also in the\\n\\njudgment aforesaid.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 15 of 19\\n\\n17. We also need to remind ourselves of the line of the judgments of\\n\\nwhich reference may only be made to State of Tamil Nadu Vs. K. Shyam\\n\\nSunder AIR 2011 SC 3470, The Bihar School Examination Board Vs.\\n\\nSubhas Chandra Sinha (1970) 1 SCC 648, The University of Mysore Vs.\\n\\nC. D. Govinda Rao AIR 1965 SC 491, Maharashtra State Board of\\n\\nSecondary and Higher Secondary Education Vs. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar\\n\\nSheth (1984) 4 SCC 27 holding that the Courts should not interfere with\\n\\nsuch decisions of the academic authorities who are experts in their field.\\n\\nOnce the experts of the appellant have taken a view that the disclosure of the\\n\\nquestion papers would compromise the selection process, we cannot lightly\\n\\ninterfere therewith. Reference in this regard may also be made to the recent\\n\\ndicta in Sanchit Bansal Vs. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) (2012) 1\\n\\nSCC 157 observing that the process of evaluation and selection of candidates\\n\\nfor admission with reference to their performance, the process of achieving\\n\\nthe objective of selecting candidates who will be better equipped to suit the\\n\\nspecialized courses, are all technical matters in academic field and Courts\\n\\nwill not interfere in such processes.\\n\\n18. We have in our judgment dated 24.05.2012 in LPA No.1090/2011\\n\\ntitled Central Board of Secondary Education Vs. Sh. Anil Kumar Kathpal,\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 16 of 19\\n\\nrelying on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs. Shaunak H.\\n\\nSatya (2011) 8 SCC 781 held that in achieving the objective of transparency\\n\\nand accountability of the RTI Act, other equally important public interests\\n\\nincluding preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information are not to\\n\\nbe ignored or sacrificed and that it has to be ensured that revelation of\\n\\ninformation in actual practice, does not harm or adversely affect other public\\n\\ninterests including of preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information.\\n\\nThus, disclosure of, marks which though existed, but were replaced by\\n\\ngrades, was not allowed. Purposive, not literal interpretation of the RTI Act\\n\\nwas advocated.\\n\\n19. We may further add that even in Central Board of Secondary\\n\\nEducation Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011) 8 SCC 497 that Apex Court\\n\\nthough holding that an examining body does not hold evaluated answer\\n\\nbooks in fiduciary relationship also held that the RTI Act seeks to bring\\n\\nabout a balance between two conflicting interests, as harmony between them\\n\\nis essential for preserving democracy i.e. of transparency and accountability\\n\\non one hand and public interest on the other hand. It was further held that\\n\\nwhen Section 8 exempts certain information, it should not be considered to\\n\\nbe a fetter on the Right to Information, but an equally important provision\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 17 of 19\\n\\nprotecting other public interests essential for fulfillment and preservation of\\n\\ndemocratic ideas. The Supreme Court further observed that it is difficult to\\n\\nvisualize and enumerate all types of information which require to be\\n\\nexempted from disclosure in public interest and the legislature has in Section\\n\\n8 however made an attempt to do so. It was thus held that while interpreting\\n\\nthe said exemptions a purposive construction involving a reasonable and\\n\\nbalanced approach ought to be adopted. It was yet further held that\\n\\nindiscriminate and impractical demands under RTI Act for disclosure of all\\n\\nand sundry information, unrelated to transparency and accountability would\\n\\nbe counter productive and the RTI Act should not be allowed to be misused\\n\\nor abused.\\n\\n20. The information seeker as aforesaid is not the examinee himself. The\\n\\npossibility of the information seeker being himself or having acted at the\\n\\ninstance of a coaching institute or a publisher and acting with the motive of\\n\\nmaking commercial gains from such information also cannot be ruled out.\\n\\nThe said fact also distinguishes the present from the context in which\\n\\nShaunak H. Satya (supra) was decided. There are no questions of\\n\\ntransparency and accountability in the present case.\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 18 of 19\\n\\n21. When we apply the tests aforesaid to the factual scenario as urged by\\n\\nthe appellants and noted above, the conclusion is irresistible that it is not in\\n\\npublic interest that the information sought be divulged and the information\\n\\nsought is such which on a purposive construction of Section 8 is exempt\\n\\nfrom disclosure.\\n\\n22. We therefore allow this appeal and set aside the orders of the CIC\\n\\ndirecting the appellant to disclose the information and the order of the\\n\\nlearned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition preferred by the appellant.\\n\\nNo order as to costs.\\n\\nRAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J\\n\\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\\n\\nMAY 28, 2012 „M‟\\n\\nLPA No.487/2011 Page 19 of 19\\n\\n5/22/2018 IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\nW.P.(C) 7048/2011\\n\\nSUDHIRRANJAN SENAPATI\\n\\nADDL.COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX .....

This petition has been filed to impugn the order dated 18.07.2011 passed by the Central Information Commission (in short CIC).\\n\\n2. The broad facts which have led to the institution of the present writ petition are as follows :-\\n\\n3. The petitioner herein is admittedly an accused in criminal proceedings lodged against him by the State, under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The prosecution of the petitioner was apparently sanctioned, at the relevant time, by the concerned authority.\\n\\n4. It is the sanction accorded qua prosecution, which triggered the petitioner?s request for furnishing information with regard to the decision arrived at in that behalf. Accordingly, an application dated 17.05.2010 was\\n\\nW.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 1 of 8\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n1/6\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\nfiled by the petitioner with the Central Public Information Officer (in short CPIO), under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (in short the RTI Act).\\n\\n4.1 More specifically, the information sought was as follows :-\\n\\n?..Certified true copies of ?all order sheet entries / Note Sheet entries / File notings of US, VandL / DS, VandL/Director, VandL/JS (Admn.)/Member (PandV)/Chairman, CBDT/Secretary, Revenue/MOS (R), if any, / Finance Minister, if any? pertaining to prosecution sanction by the Central Government u/s. 19(1)(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 vide such sanction order dated 09.04.2009 in F.No.C-14011/8/2008-VandL of Central Board of Direct Taxes, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, GOI, New Delhi..?\\n\\n4.2 The CPIO vide order dated 16/17.08.2010, declined the request for furnishing information by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Pertinently, no reasons were set out in the order. All that is said, in the order of the CPIO is that, requisite information cannot be supplied as the same is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n5. Being aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal with the First Appellate Authority. The appeal met the same fate. By an order dated 05.10.2010, the First Appellate Authority dismissed the petitioner?s appeal. The sum and substance of the rationale given in the order of the First Appellate Authority was that, since criminal prosecution was pending, information sought for by the petitioner could not be disclosed. The First Appellate Authority went on to observe in its order that, any disclosure of information prior to a final decision would be premature and injurious to the process of investigation. Accordingly, relying upon the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, it sustained the order of the CPIO.\\n\\n6. The petitioner being aggrieved, with the order of the First Appellate Authority, preferred an appeal with the CIC. The CIC by virtue of the impugned order dated 18.07.2011, rejected the petitioner?s appeal. By a cryptic order, the CIC accepted the stand of the respondents that information sought for, could not be supplied to the petitioner as the case was pending in court and that disclosure of information would impede the process of prosecution.\\n\\n7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has impugned the decision of the CIC and the authorities below on the following grounds :-\\n\\n(i). The investigation is complete. The chargesheet qua the accused,\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n2/6\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\nwhich includes the petitioner, has been filed in court. On failure of the respondents to demonstrate as to how the disclosure of information would impede prosecution of the petitioner, the said information ordinarily ought to have been supplied to the petitioner. The learned counsel for the petitioner says that disclosure of information is the rule, the denial of the same is an exception. He submits that the exception carved out in Sections 8 and 9 of the RTI Act have thus to be construed strictly.\\n\\n8. In support of the submission, the learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the judgment of a Single Judge of this Court in Bhagat Singh Vs. Chief Information Commissioner and ors., 146 (2008) DLT 385.\\n\\n9. The contesting respondents i.e., respondent nos.2 and 3 are represented by Mr. Singh, who has largely relied upon the stand taken in the counter affidavit. Mr. Singh submits that since the prosecution of the petitioner is ensuing, any disclosure of information would compromise the W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 3 of 8\\n\\ncase of the prosecution and hence, cannot be divulged. Recourse was taken to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) to support the stand of the respondents.\\n\\n9.1 Mr. Singh also relied upon a judgment of another learned Single Judge of this court, dated 10.11.2006, passed in WP(C) 16712/2006, titled Surinder Pal Singh Vs. Union of India and Others. Mr. Singh submits with all persuasive powers at his command that the facts in Surinder Pal?s case are identical to the present case and therefore having regard to the fact that the court sustained the stand of the official respondents in that case wherein information was denied by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, similar result ought to follow in the present case.\\n\\n10. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the record.\\n\\n11. At the outset, as noticed above, a chargesheet against the petitioner has been filed and the trial has commenced. Therefore, the questions which falls for consideration is: whether the case of the petitioner would come within the ambit of the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. The said provision reads as follows :-\\n\\n8. Exemption from disclosure of information ?\\n\\n(i). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen ?\\n\\n(a). x x x x\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n3/6\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n(b). x x x x\\n\\n(c). x x x x\\n\\n(d). x x x x\\n\\n(e). x x x x\\n\\n(f). x x x x\\n\\n(g). x x x x\\n\\nW.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 4 of 8\\n\\n(h). Information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders..?\\n\\n11.1 As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, a learned Single Judge of this court in Bhagat Singh?s case has construed the said provision of the Act to mean that in order to claim exemption under the said provision, the authority withholding the information must disclose satisfactory reasons as to why the release of information would hamper investigation. The reasons disclosed should be germane to the formation of opinion that the process of investigation would be hampered. The said opinion should be reasonable and based on material facts. The learned Single Judge, I may note goes on to observe that sans this consideration, Section 8(1)(h) and other such provisions of the RTI Act would become a ?haven for dogging demands for information?.\\n\\n11.2 In the light of the aforesaid observations of the learned Single Judge in Bhagat Singh?s case, one would have to see as to whether the affidavit filed on behalf of respondent nos.2 and 3 discloses the reasons as to how information sought, would hamper the prosecution of the petitioner. A perusal of the affidavit shows that no such averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by respondent nos.2 and 3. Undoubtedly, the petitioner here is seeking information with regard to the sanction accorded for his own prosecution. It cannot be disputed, as is noticed by my predecessor, in this very matter, in the order dated 14.10.2011, that the accused during the course of his prosecution can impugn the sanction accorded for his prosecution, on the basis of which the prosecution is launched. For this proposition, the learned Judge, in its order dated 14.10.2011, relies upon the\\n\\nW.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 5 of 8\\n\\nfollowing judgments :-\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n4/6\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\nState Inspector of Police, Visakhapatmam Vs. Surya Sankaran Karri (2006) 7 SCC 172 and Romesh Lal Jain Vs. Naginder Singh Rana, (2006) 1 SCC 294\\n\\n11.3 I have no reason to differ with the view taken either in Bhagat Singh case or with the prima facie view taken in the order passed by my predecessor in his order dated 14.10.2010. It is trite that an accused can challenge the order by which sanction is obtained to trigger a prosecution against the accused. If that be so, I do not see any good reason to withhold information which, in one sense, is the underlying material, which led to the final order according sanction for prosecution of the petitioner. As a matter of fact, the trial court is entitled to examine the underlying material on the basis of which sanction is accorded when a challenge is laid to it, to determine for itself as to whether the sanctioning authority had before it the requisite material to grant sanction in the matter. See observations in Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka vs The King AIR 1948 PC 82 and State of Karnataka vs Ameerjan (2007) 11 SCC 273. Therefore, the said underlying material would be crucial to the cause of the petitioner, who seeks to defend himself in criminal proceedings, which the State as the prosecutor cannot, in my opinion, withhold unless it can show that such information, would hamper prosecution.\\n\\n12. As indicated above, no reasons are set out in the counter affidavit. The argument of Mr. Singh that a Single Judge of this court in Surinder Pal Singh?s case (supra) has taken a view in favour of the respondents, is not quite correct, for the reason that the learned Single Judge in the facts and W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 6 of 8\\n\\ncircumstances of that case came to the conclusion that the apprehension of the respondent i.e., the State in that case, was ?not without any basis?.\\n\\n12.1 It appears in that case the petitioner, who was being criminally prosecuted for having fraudulently reduced the quantum of excise duty to be paid by an assessee, while passing an adjudication order, had sought information with regard to: note sheets; correspondence obtaining qua the material in the file of the CBI; correspondence in the file of the CVC pertaining to the matter; and correspondence in the file of the Department of Vigilance, CBES.\\n\\n12.2 A close perusal of the nature of information sought seems to suggests that much of it may have been material collected during the course of investigation, the disclosure of which could have perhaps hampered the prosecution of the petitioner.\\n\\n13. Therefore, in my view, in such like cases when, the State takes a stand the information cannot be disclosed; while dilating on its stand in\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013\\n\\n5/6\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 that behalf, the State would necessarily have to, deal with the aspect as to how the information sought, is of such a nature, that it could impede prosecution. Much would thus depend, on the nature of information sought, in respect of which, a clear stand needs to be taken by the\\n\\nState, while declining the information. The burden in this regard is on the State [see B.S. Mathur Vs. Public Information Officer of Delhi High Court, 180 (2011) DLT 303]\\n\\n13.1 The facts obtaining in Surinder Pal case?s are distinguishable and hence, the ratio of that judgment would not apply to the facts obtaining in the present case.\\n\\n13.2 It also be noted that the learned Single Judge?s view in Bhagat Singh\\n\\nW.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 7 of 8\\n\\ncase has been upheld by a reasoned order by the Division Bench in Directorate of Income Tax and Anr. Vs. Bhagat Singh, dated 17.12.2007 passed in LPA 1377/2007.\\n\\n14. With the aforesaid observations in place, the writ petition is allowed. The order of the CIC is set aside. The respondents will supply the information sought for by the petitioner within three weeks from today, after redacting names of officers who wrote the notes or made entries in the concerned files.

The first writ petition;\\n\\nbeing W.P.(C) No.3616/2012, assails the order dated 5.12.2011, passed by\\n\\nthe Central Information Commission (in short the CIC). In the second writ\\n\\npetition, being W.P. (C) No.405/2014, a challenge has been laid to order\\n\\ndated 26.6.2013, passed by the CIC.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThere are two issues which, according to the learned counsels for the\\n\\nparties, arise for consideration of this court. These are as follows:-\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 1 of 9\\n\\n(i) Whether, the respondent, is entitled to the information sought which,\\n\\nessentially, pertains to his own prosecution in a criminal case lodged by the\\n\\nCentral Bureau of Investigation (in short the CBI)?\\n\\n(ii) Whether, the notification dated 9.6.2011 whereby, the CBI has been\\n\\nincluded in the second schedule to the Right to Information Act, 2005 (in\\n\\nshort the RTI Act), will impact the applications filed by the respondent prior\\n\\nto the said date, i.e., on 28.02.2011 and 5.5.2011?\\n\\n3.\\n\\nBefore I proceed further, I may only indicate that the respondent had\\n\\nfiled a third application under the RTI Act, which is, dated 26.12.2011. The\\n\\nrespondent, who appears in person, says that he does not wish to press the\\n\\napplication dated 26.12.2011.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe matter has reached this court in the background of the following\\n\\nfacts:\\n\\n4.1 The respondent, who at one time, was serving as the Chairperson of\\n\\nthe Appellate Tribunal for Foreign Exchange (in short the Tribunal), had a\\n\\ncriminal case registered against him by the CBI. This case was registered by\\n\\nthe CBI, in 2007. The investigation, in this case, was carried on and,\\n\\nadmittedly, a charge sheet was filed by the CBI, in the competent court on\\n\\n20.12.2010.\\n\\n4.2\\n\\nI am informed by the respondent that no charges have been framed to\\n\\ndate.\\n\\n4.3 Be that as it may, on 28.2.2011, the respondent filed an application\\n\\nbefore the Central Public Information Officer (in short the CPIO) of the\\n\\nCBI, seeking information with regard to certain aspects. Since, information\\n\\nwas not furnished to the respondent, the respondent preferred an application\\n\\nwith the First Appellate Authority (in short the FAA).\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 2 of 9\\n\\n4.4 On 18.4.2011, some part of the information was supplied to the\\n\\nrespondent. The CPIO, also filed, its reply to the appeal, on 3.5.2011, which\\n\\nwas finally disposed of by the FAA on 5.5.2011. The petitioner on that very\\n\\ndate, filed a second application under the RTI Act. This application is also\\n\\ndated 5.5.2011.\\n\\n4.5 The respondent, being aggrieved by the order dated 5.5.2011, passed\\n\\nby the FAA, decided to prefer a second appeal with the CIC. This appeal\\n\\nwas filed on 1.6.2011. Pertinently, while the appeal was pending before the\\n\\nCIC, on 9.6.2011, the Government of India issued a notification whereby,\\n\\nCBI was placed in the second schedule of the RTI Act, as indicated above.\\n\\nThe effect of this notification and the inclusion of the CBI in the second\\n\\nschedule was that it could avail of the protective shield provided by Section\\n\\n24 of the RTI Act. In other words, agencies which are included in the\\n\\nsecond schedule of the RTI Act, are exempted from the provisions of the\\n\\nRTI. The exception of course being, qua information pertaining to\\n\\nallegations of corruption and human rights violation.\\n\\n4.6 The CIC, vide order dated 5.12.2011 partially allowed the appeal of\\n\\nthe respondent. The operative directions contained in the order of the CIC\\n\\nare as under:\\n\\nIn any contingency, the Commission hereby directs “8. that the information sought by the Appellant on Query Nos.3 & 6 of his RTI Application must be provided to him free of cost within 15 days of the receipt of this Order. Since the information sought by the Appellant under Query No.1 is not maintained in its official record by the Respondent Ministry, the Commission cannot direct the Respondent to create and provide the same. However, it shall be open for the Respondent Ministry to call for such information from the CBI, in case it decides\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 3 of 9\\n\\nto complete and maintain its own official file records and if so happens, then the Appellate will be entitled to get such information under the RTI Act.”\\n\\n4.7 To be noted, the directions contained in paragraph 8 were passed in\\n\\nthe context of the queries set out in the respondent’s application dated\\n\\n28.2.2011. The queries, which the respondent made and in respect of which\\n\\nhe had sought information are set out in paragraph 1 of the order dated\\n\\n5.12.2011, passed by the CIC. The queries, as recorded in the order, are\\n\\nextracted hereinafter:\\n\\n“1. The date and nature of permission sought for by the CBI in 2007 to register a criminal case against Sh. O.P. Nahar, the then Chairman ATFE, and the documents filed in support of the request.\\n\\n2. Whether sought for permission is granted or declined and on what date along with reasons for such decision.\\n\\n3. The notings recorded by the CVO and the Law Secretary while taking decision on the request of the CBI. Also name the final authority who took decision on the above described request and the reasons thereof.\\n\\n4. Any replies, if sought for from Sh. O.P. Nahar before taking the final decision then supply the comments received from him.\\n\\n5. Provide details of procedure adopted with documents before taking final decision on the matter.\\n\\n6. Did CBI request on second occasion in 2009 for the grant of permission, if yes, then supply the date and copy of the second request or otherwise the first decision is over-ruled suo moto on the same facts narrated in the CBI’s request. Please supply the documents and the notings made by the CVO, the Law Secretary or any other authority functioning\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 4 of 9\\n\\nin this regard.\\n\\n7. Is it a fact firstly that the 2007 request by CBI was declined but later in 2009 same request is granted without any addition of fresh factual difference or fresh request, if so, then supply the reasons recorded for change of the old decision and name the authority with their notings on what they recorded this regard”.\\n\\n4.8 Since directions were issued by the CIC only with regard to query\\n\\nNos.1, 3 & 6, the same are set out hereinbelow:\\n\\n“1. The date and nature of permission sought for by the CBI in 2007 to register a criminal case against Shri O.P. Nahar, the then Chairman ATFE and the documents filed in support of the request...”\\n\\n“3. The notings recorded by the CVO and the Law Secretary while taking decision on the request of the CBI. Also name the final authority who took decision on the above described request and the reasons thereof...”\\n\\nDid CBI request on second occasion in 2009 for “6. the grant of permission, if yes, then supply the date and copy of the second request or otherwise the first decision is over-ruled suo moto on the same facts narrated in the CBI’s request. Please supply the documents and the notings made by the CVO, the Law Secretary or any other authority functioning in this regard...”\\n\\n4.9.\\n\\nInsofar as the second order of the CIC is concerned, which is dated\\n\\n26.6.2013, the operative directions passed by the CIC are contained in\\n\\nparagraph 10 of the said order. For the sake of convenience, the same are\\n\\nextracted hereinbelow:\\n\\n“10. Having considered the submissions of the parties\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 5 of 9\\n\\nand perused the relevant documents on the file, the Commission finds that the CBI has been exempted under the provisions of the RTI Act vide Notification dated 9.6.2011 whereas the appellant’s RTI application is dated to the said Notification. 5.5.2011, which is prior Therefore, the CBI was not an exempted organisation at the time of filing of the RTI application. Moreover, it has not been explained by the respondent how the disclosure of the information in the present case can impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders, which is admittedly over. The Commission hereby directs the Deputy Secretary/Vig. & CPIO to provide to the appellant the documents as requested by him at Para 9 above within two weeks of receipt of this order.”\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe issues, therefore, in these facts, which arise for consideration,\\n\\nhave been set out hereinabove.\\n\\n6. Mr. Mishra, who appears for the CBI, says that CBI is not obliged to\\n\\nprovide any information of the kind that CIC has directed for the reason that\\n\\nit is an agency which falls within the ambit of the second schedule of the\\n\\nRTI Act.\\n\\n6.1 This apart, it is Mr. Mishra’s contention that the provisions of Section\\n\\n8(1)(h) of the Act clearly provides that notwithstanding anything contained\\n\\nin the RTI Act, there would be no obligation on the holder of information to\\n\\nprovide such information which would impede the process of investigation\\n\\nor apprehension or prosecution of the offenders.\\n\\n6.2 This submission is made by Mr. Mishra in support of his contention\\n\\nthat, even if, the respondent’s stand was to be accepted, that a vested right\\n\\nenured in his favour, on 28.2.2011, and thereafter on 5.5.2011, the said\\n\\ninformation, can be denied if, the information would “impede” investigation\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 6 of 9\\n\\nor apprehension or prosecution of the offender.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe respondent, who appears in person, says that the provision of the\\n\\nAct, in particular, Section 7 is indicative of the fact that the holder of the\\n\\ninformation, i.e. a public authority, is required to furnish the information\\n\\nwithin a period of 30 days. The respondent submits that the period of 30\\n\\ndays, in this case, was well and truly over, if one were to have regard to the\\n\\ndate of the first application, which is, dated 28.2.2011.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nInsofar as the second application is concerned, the period of 30 days\\n\\nalso came to an end prior to the date of notification, which is, 9.6.2011.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nI have heard the learned counsels for the parties. According to me,\\n\\nwhat is important is the events which occurred prior to the issuance of the\\n\\nnotification dated 9.6.2011. Admittedly, two applications were filed by the\\n\\nrespondent to seek information. The first application, as indicated above, is\\n\\ndated 28.2.2011. The second application is dated 5.5.2011.\\n\\n10.\\n\\nI had asked Mr. Mishra as to what was the date of receipt of the\\n\\napplication, which is dated 5.5.2011. Mr. Mishra was not able to furnish\\n\\nany information in that regard.\\n\\n10.1 The moot point, which has been raised in the second petition, is\\n\\nwhether notification dated 9.6.2011, will apply, to an application filed prior\\n\\nto that date. The said aspect should have, therefore, been adverted to by the\\n\\npetitioner in, at least, the second writ petition. Therefore, it will have to be\\n\\npresumed, at this juncture, that the application was received by the petitioner\\n\\nherein on 5.5.2011.\\n\\n11. Having regard to the provisions of Section 7 of the RTI, it was\\n\\nincumbent upon the petitioner to furnish the information sought, if otherwise\\n\\npermissible, under the provisions of the RTI Act, within 30 days of the\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 7 of 9\\n\\nreceipt of the application. The information having not been supplied, a\\n\\nvested right accrued in favour of the respondent after the completion of the\\n\\n30 days and, therefore, notification dated 9.6.2011 insofar as the respondent\\n\\nis concerned, in my view cannot come in his way. Therefore, this would be\\n\\nthe position not only vis-a-vis the application dated 28.02.2011 but also qua\\n\\napplication dated 05.05.2011.\\n\\n12. This brings me to the other question, which is: whether the petitioner\\n\\ncan take recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the Act to deny\\n\\ninformation to the respondent. The relevant provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of\\n\\nthe RTI Act read as follows:-\\n\\n“8. Exemption from disclosure of information. — (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,— ... (h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders;\\n\\n(emphasis is mine)\\n\\n13. A careful reading of the provision would show that the holder of the\\n\\ninformation can only withhold the information if, it is able to demonstrate\\n\\nthat the information would “impede” the process of investigation or\\n\\napprehension or prosecution of the offenders.\\n\\n14.\\n\\nIn the present case, the facts, as set out hereinabove, clearly\\n\\ndemonstrate that the investigation is over. The charge sheet in the case was\\n\\nfiled, as far back as on 31.12.2010.\\n\\n14.1 The question then is, would the information sought for by the\\n\\nrespondent “impede” the respondent’s apprehension or prosecution. The\\n\\nrespondent is in court and he says that he has been granted bail by the\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 8 of 9\\n\\ncompetent court. Therefore, prima faice, the view of the competent court,\\n\\nwhich is trying him, is that there is no impediment in apprehending the\\n\\nrespondent, and that he would be available as and when required by the\\n\\ncourt. The petition makes no averments as to how the information sought\\n\\nfor by the respondent would prevent his prosecution.\\n\\n14.2 In that view of the matter, according to me the provisions of Section\\n\\n8(1)(h) of the RTI Act will not help the cause of the petitioner.\\n\\nAccordingly, the information, as directed by the CIC, will have to be\\n\\nsupplied to the respondent. It so ordered. In support of this proposition, I\\n\\nmay only advert to the following judgments of this Court (See Bhagat\\n\\nSingh v. Chief Information Commissioner [2008 (100) DRJ 63]; B.S.\\n\\nMathur v. Public Information Officer of Delhi High Court [180 (2011)\\n\\nDLT 303]; Adesh Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. [216 (2015) DLT\\n\\n230]; Director of Income Tax (Investigation) and Anr. v. Bhagat Singh\\n\\nand Anr. [(2008) 168 TAXMAN 190 (Delhi)]; Sudhir Ranjan Senapati v.\\n\\nAddl.

JUSTICE MANMOHAN\\n\\nJ U D G M E N T\\n\\nMANMOHAN, J: (Oral)\\n\\n1.\\n\\nPresent batch of writ petitions has been filed challenging the orders of\\n\\nthe Central Information Commission (for short ‘CIC’) whereby the\\n\\npetitioner-Ministry of External Affairs has been directed to provide copies\\n\\nof passports of third parties along with their birth certificates, educational\\n\\nqualifications and identity proofs. Since the reasoning of the CIC in all the\\n\\nimpugned orders is identical, the relevant portion of the impugned order in\\n\\nW.P.(C) 3406/2012 is reproduced hereinbelow:-\\n\\n“We can also look at this from another aspect. The State has no right to invade the privacy of individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a Citizen. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply;- usually with certain safeguards. Therefore where the State routinely obtains information from Citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy.\\n\\nCertain human rights such as liberty, freedom of expression or right to life are universal and therefore would apply uniformly to all human beings worldwide. However, the concept of „privacy‟ is a cultural notion, related to social norms, and different societies would look at these differently. Therefore referring to the UK Data protection act or the laws of other countries to define „privacy‟ cannot be considered a valid exercise to constrain the Citizen‟s fundamental Right to Information in India. Parliament has not codified the right to privacy so far, hence in balancing the Right to Information of Citizens and the\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 2 of 9\\n\\nindividual‟s Right to Privacy the Citizen‟s Right to Information would be given greater weightage. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Citizens have a right to know about charges against candidates for elections as well as details of their assets, since they desire to offer themselves for public service. It is obvious then that those who are public servants cannot claim exemption from disclosure of charges against them or details of their assets. Given our dismal record of misgovernance and rampant corruption which colludes to deny Citizens their essential rights and dignity, it is in the fitness of things that the Citizen‟s Right to Information is given greater primacy with regard to privacy.”\\n\\n2.\\n\\nDespite filing affidavit of service, none has appeared for the\\n\\nrespondents today. Even yesterday, none had appeared for the respondents.\\n\\nConsequently, this Court has no other option but to proceed with the matter\\n\\nex parte.\\n\\n3. Mr. Rakesh Tiku, learned senior counsel for petitioners submits that\\n\\nCIC failed to appreciate that the passport application contains personal\\n\\ninformation and if disclosed, would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy\\n\\nof third party. He further submits that even if the CIC came to the\\n\\nconclusion that the information sought for was not exempt from disclosure\\n\\nunder Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short ‘RTI\\n\\nAct’), it would still have to follow the third party information procedure\\n\\nunder Section 11 of the RTI Act.\\n\\n4. Mr. Tiku fairly points out that in connected matters, i.e., W.P.(C) Nos.\\n\\n2232/2012, 8932/2011, 3421/2012, 1263/2012, 1677/2012, 1794/2012,\\n\\n2231/2012, a co-ordinate bench of this Court has directed the Ministry of\\n\\nExternal Affairs to give details of passport to third parties like passport\\n\\nnumber, date of its first issue, subsequent renewals, the name of police\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 3 of 9\\n\\nstation from which verification had been done, nature of documents\\n\\nsubmitted with the passport application without disclosing the contents of\\n\\nthose documents along with the information as to whether Visa was issued\\n\\nto the third party.\\n\\n5. Mr. Tiku, however, submits that the reasoning in W.P.(C) 2232/2012\\n\\nfor release of third party information that the said information was generated\\n\\nby Ministry of External Affairs, is untenable in law. According to him, if\\n\\nthis reasoning were to be accepted, then a third party’s Permanent Account\\n\\nNumber (PAN) and password would also be liable to be disclosed as the\\n\\nsame are generated by the Income Tax Department. He states that if an\\n\\napplicant were to get a third party’s PAN and password details, he would be\\n\\nable to find out his financial details like income, tax paid etc.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nThis Court finds that the concept of third party information has been\\n\\ncomprehensively dealt with in the RTI Act. Some of the relevant sections\\n\\npertaining to third party as well as personal information are reproduced\\n\\nhereinbelow:-\\n\\n“2. Definitions.—In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n(n) “third party”\\' means a person other than the citizen making a request for information and includes a public authority. xxxx xxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n8. Exemption information. —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,— xxxx\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 4 of 9\\n\\ninterest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n11. Third party information.—(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party.\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n19. Appeal.-\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n(4) If the decision of the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, against\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 5 of 9\\n\\nwhich an appeal is preferred relates to information of a third party, the Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the case may be, shall give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to that third party.”\\n\\n7.\\n\\nKeeping in view the aforesaid provisions, this Court is of the view\\n\\nthat the proper approach to be adopted in cases where personal information\\n\\nwith regard to third parties is asked is first to determine whether information\\n\\nsought falls under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and if the Court/Tribunal\\n\\nreaches the conclusion that aforesaid exemption is not attracted, then the\\n\\nthird party procedure referred to in Section 11(1) of the RTI Act must be\\n\\nfollowed before releasing the information.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThis Court finds that except making general observations in the\\n\\nimpugned matters, CIC has not considered the aforesaid binding statutory\\n\\nprovisions. In fact, the impugned order is based on surmises and conjectures.\\n\\nCIC has not pointed out as to how any of its general observations with\\n\\nregard to mis-governance, rampant corruption by public servants and\\n\\npoliticians have any relevance to the present batch of cases. CIC has\\n\\nnowhere stated in the impugned orders that third parties are either public\\n\\nservants or politicians or persons in power.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nCIC has neither examined the issue whether larger public interest\\n\\njustifies the disclosure of the information sought by the applicants in these\\n\\ncases nor has followed the third party procedure prescribed under Sections\\n\\n11 and 19(4) of RTI Act.\\n\\n10. This Court also finds that the observations given by learned Single\\n\\nJudge in the batch of writ petitions being W.P.(C) 2232/2012 are without\\n\\ntaking into account the binding provisions of Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 6 of 9\\n\\nRTI Act. In particular the learned Single Judge erred in observing in\\n\\nW.P.(C) 1677/2012 that passport number is not a personal information. This\\n\\nCourt is in agreement with Mr. Tiku’s submission that as to who generates a\\n\\nthird party information, is totally irrelevant. After all passport number is not\\n\\nonly personal information but also an identification proof, specifically when\\n\\none travels abroad.\\n\\n11. This Court is also of the view that if passport number of a third party\\n\\nis furnished to an applicant, it can be misused. For instance, if the applicant\\n\\nwere to lodge a report with the police that a passport bearing a particular\\n\\nnumber is lost, the Passport Authority would automatically revoke the same\\n\\nwithout knowledge and to the prejudice of the third party.\\n\\n12. Further, the observations of learned Single Judge in the aforesaid\\n\\nbatch of writ petitions are contrary to the judgment of another learned Single\\n\\nJudge in Suhas Chakma Vs. Central Information Commission, W.P.(C) 9118/2009 decided on 2nd January, 2010 as well as a Division Bench’s\\n\\njudgment in Harish Kumar Vs. Provost Marshal-Cum-Appellate Authority & Ors., LPA 253/2012 decided on 30th March, 2012. In Suhas Chakma\\n\\n(supra) another learned Single Judge has held as under:-\\n\\n“5. The Court is of the considered view that information which involves the rights of privacy of a third party in terms of Section 8(1)(j) RTI Act cannot be ordered to be disclosed without notice to such third party. The authority cannot simply come to conclusion, that too, on a concession or on the agreement of parties before it, that public interest overrides the privacy rights of such third party without notice to and hearing such third party.”\\n\\n13. The relevant portion of the Division Bench in Harish Kumar (supra)\\n\\nis reproduced hereinbelow:-\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 7 of 9\\n\\n“9. What we find in the present case is that the PIO had not refused the information. All that the PIO required the appellant to do was, to follow third party procedure. No error can be found in the said reasoning of the PIO. Under Section 11 of the Act, the PIO if called upon to disclose any information relating to or supplied by a third party and which is to be treated as confidential, is required to give a notice to such third party and is to give an opportunity to such third party to object to such disclosure and to take a decision only thereafter.\\n\\n10. There can be no dispute that the information sought by the appellant was relating to a third party and supplied by a third party. We may highlight that the appellant also wanted to know the caste as disclosed by his father-in-law in his service record. The PIO was thus absolutely right in, response to the application for information of the appellant, calling upon the appellant to follow the third party procedure under Section 11. Reliance by the PIO on Section 8 (1) (j) which exempts from disclosure of personal information and the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest and which would cause unwanted invasion of the privacy of the individual was also apposite. Our constitutional aim is for a casteless society and it can safely be assumed that the disclosure made by a person of his or her caste is intended by such person to be kept confidential. The appellant however as aforesaid, wanted to steal a march over his father-in-law by accessing information, though relating to and supplied by the father-in-law, without allowing his father-in-law to oppose to such request.”\\n\\n14. The Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Gurman\\n\\nKaur, (1989) 1 SCC 101 has held that a decision of a Court is per incuriam\\n\\nwhen it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute. In the present case, as\\n\\nthe direction of learned Single Judge in the aforesaid batch of writ petitions\\n\\nbearing W.P.(c) 2232/2012 is specifically contrary to Section 11(1) of the\\n\\nRTI Act, this Court is of the view that it is per incuriam.\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 8 of 9\\n\\n15. Consequently, present writ petitions are allowed and the impugned orders dated 11th April, 2012 passed in W.P.(C) 3406/2012; 21st October, 2011 in W.P.(C) 8915/2011; and 19th December, 2011 in W.P.(C) 410/2012 by CIC are set aside. The applications stand disposed of.\\n\\nMANMOHAN, J\\n\\nFEBRUARY 19, 2014 rn\\n\\nW.Ps.(C) 3406/2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012\\n\\nPage 9 of 9\\n\\n\\n\\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\nJudgment reserved on: 27.04.2009 Judgment pronounced on: 01.07.2009\\n\\n+\\n\\nW.P.

Ravindra Bhat\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe petitioner in this proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,\\n\\nchallenges a decision of the Central Information Commission (CIC) dated 17.12.2008 (the\\n\\nimpugned order] affirming the decision of the appellate authority under the Right to\\n\\nInformation Act, 2005 *hereafter, “the Information Act”+ not to allow disclosure of the\\n\\ninformation sought.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe facts necessary for deciding the case are that the petitioner is a former officer of the\\n\\nIndian Air Force. He apparently got married in 2001. According to the averments, he had sought\\n\\nresignation from the Indian Air Force, which was granted on 30.09.2001. His wife was inducted\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 1 of 16\\n\\nin the Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO) on 31.03.2005 and was posted at 4,\\n\\nAir Force Selection Board (“AFSB”), Varanasi. Eventually, differences cropped up between the\\n\\ntwo, and his wife applied for divorce. The petitioner caused to be served, through his counsel,\\n\\nan application to the Station Commander, 4 AFSB, requesting for information in respect of his\\n\\nwife’s service records pertaining to all leave application forms submitted by her; attested copies\\n\\nof nomination of DSOP and other official documents with financial implications, and the\\n\\nchanges made to them; record of investments made and reflected in the service documents of\\n\\nhis wife, along with nominations thereof.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe information application was declined by the Public Information Officer, i.e. the Wing\\n\\nCommander of the 4, AFSB by his letter dated 25.04.2007 on the ground that the particulars\\n\\nsought for related to personal information, exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the Information\\n\\nAct; that disclosure of such information had no relation with any public activity or interest and\\n\\nthat it would cause unwarranted invasion into the privacy of the individual. The petitioner felt\\n\\naggrieved and preferred an appeal under Section 19 of the Information Act. The appeal was\\n\\nrejected by an order dated 25.01.2008 by the Air Vice Marshal, Senior Officer Incharge,\\n\\nAdministration, of the Indian Air Force, who was the designated Appellate authority. Feeling\\n\\naggrieved, the writ petitioner preferred a second appeal to the Central Information\\n\\nCommissioner.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nBy the impugned order, the CIC, after discussing the arguments and pleas advanced,\\n\\nrejected the appeal. The relevant part of the impugned order, upholding the determination of\\n\\nthe authorities, including the appellate authority is as follows:-\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 2 of 16\\n\\n“During the hearing, the Appellant submitted that the information sought was required for producing before the Competent Court where a dispute was pending between him and Dr. Sandhya Verma and the information was necessary for fair trial. The Respondents submitted that the information was necessary pertained to personal information concerning Dr. Sandhya Verma, a Third Party and had no relationship to any public interest or activity and, therefore, exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act. The information which has been sought includes, attested copies of all the leave application forms submitted by Dr. S. Verma since she was posted to 4 AFSB, copies of nomination of DSOP/other official documents with financial implications and record of investment made and reflected thereon in service documents along with the nominations thereof, if explicitly made. The information sought is obviously personal information concerning Dr. Sandhya Verma, a Third Party. It is immaterial if Dr. Sandhya Verma happens to be the wife of the Appellant. The information sought does not seem to have any relationship to any public interest or public activity and has been expressly sought to be used as evidence in a dispute in a Court pending between the Appellant and Dr. Sandhya Verma. The decision of the CPIO, upheld by the Appellate Authority, in denying the information by invoking the exemption provision of Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act seem to be absolutely right and just. We find no reason to interfere with the decision of the Appellate Authority and, thus, reject the appeal.”\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe writ petitioner, a self-represented litigant, argues that the approach of the\\n\\nauthorities under the Information Act has been unduly narrow and technical. He emphasized\\n\\nthat by virtue of Section 6, a right is vested in every person to claim information of all sorts\\n\\nwhich exists on the record. He relied upon Section 2 (i) and (j) to say that information under the\\n\\nAct has been defined in the widest possible manner and that the question of exceptions should\\n\\nbe construed from the perspective of the right rather than the exemptions, which has been\\n\\ndone in this case. Reliance was placed upon Division Bench ruling in Surup Singh Hrya Naik v.\\n\\nState of Maharashtra AIR 2007 Bom 121 to submit that ordinarily information sought for by\\n\\nperson must be made available without disclosure by him about the reason why he seeks it. It is\\n\\nsubmitted further that a close reading of the decision would show that the public right to\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 3 of 16\\n\\ninformation ordinarily prevails over the private interest of a third party, who may be affected.\\n\\nParticularly, it was emphasized that the Court should always keep in mind the object of the Act,\\n\\nwhich is to make public authorities accountable and open and the contention that the\\n\\ninformation might be misused is of no consequence. It was submitted lastly that even if there is\\n\\na rule prohibiting disclosure of information, that would yield to the dictates of the Information\\n\\nAct, as the latter acquires supremacy.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIt was consequently urged that in the context of this case, the information sought for\\n\\nwas not really of a third party, but pertained to the petitioner’s wife. Although they are facing\\n\\neach other in litigation, nevertheless, having regard to their relationship, the invocation of\\n\\nSection 8(1)(j) was not justified.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe petitioner contended further that the grounds urged, i.e. lack of public interest and\\n\\nunwarranted intrusion of privacy, were unavailable in this case. It was submitted in this regard\\n\\nthat being a public official, the petitioner’s wife was under a duty to make proper and truthful\\n\\ndisclosure; the pleadings made by her in the divorce proceedings, contained untruthful\\n\\naverments. These could be effectively negatived by disclosure of information available with the\\n\\nrespondents. Therefore, there was sufficient public interest in the disclosure of information.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF), which has been impleaded as second respondent argues that\\n\\nthe impugned decision is justified and in consonance with law. It argued that what constitutes\\n\\n“public interest” is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Edition) at page 1229 as follows:\\n\\n“Public Interest: Something in which the public, the community at large, has some pecuniary interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. It\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 4 of 16\\n\\ndoes not mean anything so narrow as mere curiosity, or as the interests of the particular localities, which may be affected by the matters in question……”\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIt is urged that the Information Act was brought into force as a means of accessing\\n\\ninformation under the control of public authorities, to citizens with the object of promoting\\n\\ntransparency and accountability. This regime, is however, subject to reasonable restrictions or\\n\\nexemptions. Particular reliance is placed upon the non-obstante clause contained in Section 8,\\n\\nwhich lists out the various exemptions. It was submitted that if the disclosure of personal\\n\\ninformation has no relation to any public activity or interest, the authorities under the Act\\n\\nwithin their rights in denying disclosure. The counsel contended in this regard that there is no\\n\\nelement of public interest, in relation to the private matrimonial litigation pending before the\\n\\nCourt between the petitioner and his wife. Similarly, the action of filing information in relation\\n\\nto one’s assets and investments, with the public authority, per se, is not a public activity, and\\n\\ncontents of such disclosure cannot be accessed. It was argued that in addition, the disclosure of\\n\\nsuch information (which is meant purely for the records and for the use of the employer),\\n\\nduring inappropriate instances, is bound to cause unwarranted loss of privacy to the individual.\\n\\nTherefore, in the overall conspectus of the facts of this case, even though the parties were\\n\\nmarried to each other, as a policy matter, the IAF acted within the bounds of law in denying\\n\\naccess to the information submitted by the petitioner’s wife.\\n\\n10.\\n\\nThe relevant provisions of the Information Act, in the context of this case, are extracted\\n\\nbelow:\\n\\n“2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 5 of 16\\n\\n(f) “information” means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force;\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\n(j) “right to information” means the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to-\\n\\n(i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device;\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\n8. Exemption from disclosure of information.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,-\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\\n\\nProvided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament\\n\\nor a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nXXXXXX\\n\\nThird party information.-(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer 11. or a State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 6 of 16\\n\\nPublic Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information:\\n\\nProvided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party.\\n\\n(2) Where a notice is served by the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under sub-section (1) to a third party in respect of any information or record or part thereof, the third party shall, within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice, be given the opportunity to make representation against the proposed disclosure.\\n\\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 7, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under Section 6, if the third party has been given an opportunity to make representation under sub-section(2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice of his decision to the third party.\\n\\n(4) A notice given under sub-section (3) shall include a statement that the third party to whom the notice is given is entitled to prefer an appeal under section 19 against the decision.”\\n\\n11.\\n\\nThe precise question to be decided here is whether records relating to investments of,\\n\\nand financial disclosure made during the course of employment by the petitioner’s wife were\\n\\njustifiably withheld on grounds of lack of public interest element and likelihood of invasion of\\n\\nprivacy.\\n\\n12.\\n\\nIn the decision relied upon by the petitioner reported as Surup Singh Hrya Naik v. State\\n\\nof Maharashtra (supra), the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether\\n\\ndisclosure of medical records of a member of the Legislative Assembly, who had been\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 7 of 16\\n\\nimprisoned for contempt of Court, for a month, was protected by the exemption under Section\\n\\n8(1)(j). The Court dealt with the argument that in terms of regulations framed by the Indian\\n\\nMedical Council (IMC), such records were confidential. However, the argument that such\\n\\nconfidentiality obliged the Government to deny the request, was turned-down on the ground\\n\\nthat the regulations had to yield to provisions of the Act and that unless the third party made\\n\\nout a strong case for denial, such information could always be disclosed. In the course of its\\n\\nreasoning, the Division Bench emphasized that the proviso to Section 8(1)(j) clothes Parliament\\n\\nand State Legislatures with plenary powers, which in turn implied that all manner of\\n\\ninformation was capable of disclosure and could not, therefore, be withheld.\\n\\n13.\\n\\nUnder the scheme of the Information Act, the expressions “record”, “information”,\\n\\n“right to Information” have been given the widest possible amplitude. By virtue of Sections 3, 5,\\n\\n6 and 7, every public authority requested to provide information is under a positive obligation\\n\\nto do so; the information seeker is under no obligation to disclose why he requests it. The\\n\\ninformation provider or the concerned agency is further, obliged to decide the application\\n\\nwithin prescribed time limits. A hierarchy of authorities is created with the CIC, at the apex to\\n\\ndecide disputes pertaining to information disclosure. In this Scheme, the Parliament has in its\\n\\nwisdom, visualized certain exemptions. Section 8 lists those exemptions; it opens with a non-\\n\\nobstante clause, signifying the intention that irrespective of the rights of the information\\n\\nseeker, in regard to matters listed under that provision, the information providers can\\n\\njustifiably withhold access to the information seeker the record, information or queries sought\\n\\nfor by him. This case concerns the applicability of Section 8(1)(j).\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 8 of 16\\n\\n14.\\n\\nThe right to access public information, that is, information in the possession of state\\n\\nagencies and governments, in democracies is an accountability measure empowering citizens to\\n\\nbe aware of the actions taken by such state “actors”. This transparency value, at the same time,\\n\\nhas to be reconciled with the legal interests protected by law, such as other fundamental rights,\\n\\nparticularly the fundamental right to privacy. This balancing or reconciliation becomes even\\n\\nmore crucial if we take into account the effects of the technological challenges which arise on\\n\\naccount of privacy. Certain conflicts may arise in particular cases of access to information and\\n\\nthe protection of personal data, stemming from the fact that both rights cannot be exercised\\n\\nabsolutely. The rights of all those affected must be respected, and no right can prevail over\\n\\nothers, except in clear and express circumstances.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nTo achieve the above purpose, the Information Act outlines a clear list of the matters\\n\\nthat cannot be made public. There are two types of information seen as exceptions to access;\\n\\nthe first usually refers to those matters limited to the State in protection of the general public\\n\\ngood, such as security of State, matters relating to investigation, sensitive cabinet deliberations,\\n\\netc. In cases where state information is reserved, the relevant authorities must prove the\\n\\ndamage that diffusion of information will effectively cause to the legal interests protected by\\n\\nlaw, so that the least amount of information possible is reserved to benefit the individual, thus\\n\\nfacilitating governmental activities. The second class of information with state or its agencies, is\\n\\npersonal data of both citizens and artificial or juristic entities, like corporations. Individuals’\\n\\npersonal data is protected by the laws of access to confidentiality and by privacy rights.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 9 of 16\\n\\n16.\\n\\nDemocratic societies undoubtedly have to guarantee the right of access to public\\n\\ninformation; it is also true that such societies’ legal regimes must safeguard the individual’s\\n\\nright to privacy. Both these rights are often found at the same “regulatory level”. The Universal\\n\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, through Article 19 articulates the right to information as follows:\\n\\n“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.\\n\\nArticle 12 of the same Declaration provides that,\\n\\n“no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks”.\\n\\n17.\\n\\nThe scheme of the Information Act no doubt is premised on disclosure being the norm,\\n\\nand refusal, the exception. Apart from the classes of exceptions, they also appear to work at\\n\\ndifferent levels or stages, in the enactment. Thus, for instance, several organizations –security,\\n\\nand intelligence agencies, are excluded from the regime, by virtue of Section 24, read with the\\n\\nSecond Schedule to the Act. The second level of exception is enacted in Section 8, which lists 11\\n\\ncategories or classes (clauses (a) to (j)) that serve as guidelines for non-disclosure. Though by\\n\\nSection 22, the Act overrides other laws, the opening non-obstante clause in Section 8\\n\\n(“notwithstanding anything contained in this Act”) confers primacy to the exemptions, enacted\\n\\nunder Section 8(1). Clause (j) embodies the exception of information in the possession of the\\n\\npublic authority which relates to a third party. Simply put, this exception is that if the\\n\\ninformation concerns a third party (i.e. a party other than the information seeker and the\\n\\ninformation provider), unless a public interest in disclosure is shown, information would not be\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 10 of 16\\n\\ngiven; information may also be refused on the ground that disclosure may result in\\n\\nunwarranted intrusion of privacy of the individual. Significantly, the enactment makes no\\n\\ndistinction between a private individual third party and a public servant or public official third\\n\\nparty.\\n\\n18.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that paradoxically, the right to privacy, recognized as a\\n\\nfundamental right by our Supreme Court, has found articulation – by way of a safeguard,\\n\\nthough limited, against information disclosure, under the Information Act. In India, there is no\\n\\nlaw relating to data protection, or privacy; privacy rights have evolved through the interpretive\\n\\nprocess. The right to privacy, characterized by Justice Brandeis in his memorable dissent, in\\n\\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 US 438 (1928) as \"\"right to be let alone… the most\\n\\ncomprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilised men\" has been recognized under\\n\\nour Constitution by the Supreme Court in four rulings - Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (1964) 1\\n\\nSCR 332; Gobind v. State of M.P., (1975) 2 SCC 148; R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N., (1994) 6 SCC\\n\\n632; and District Registrar and Collector v. Canara Bank,(2005) 1 SCC 496. None of these\\n\\njudgments, however explored the intersect between the two values of information rights and\\n\\nprivacy rights; Rajagopal, which is nearest in point, was concerned to an extent with publication\\n\\nof material that was part of court records.\\n\\n19.\\n\\nIt has been held by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court that an individual does\\n\\nnot forfeit his fundamental rights, by becoming a public servant, in O.K. Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph AIR\\n\\n1963 SC 812:\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 11 of 16\\n\\n“...the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 19 can be claimed by Government servants. Art. 33 which confers power on the parliament to modify the rights in their application to the Armed Forces, clearly brings out the fact that all citizens, including Government servants, are entitled to claim the rights guaranteed by Art. 19.”\\n\\nEarlier, in Kameshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar AIR 1962 1166, an argument that public servants\\n\\ndo not possess certain fundamental rights, was repelled, by another Constitution Bench,\\n\\ncategorically, in these terms:\\n\\n“It was said that a Government servant who was posted to a particular place could obviously not exercise the freedom to move throughout the territory of India and similarly, his right to reside and settle in any part of India could be said to be violated by his being posted to any particular place. Similarly, so long as he was in government service he would not be entitled to practice any profession or trade and it was therefore urged that to hold that these freedoms guaranteed under Art. 19 were applicable to government servants would render public service or administration impossible. This line of argument, however, does not take into account the limitations which might be imposed on the exercise of these rights by cls. (5) and (6) under which restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by sub-cls. (d) and (g) may be imposed if reasonable in the interest of the general public.\\n\\n13. In this connection he laid stress on the fact that special provision had been made in regard to Service under the State in some of the Articles in Part III - such as for instance Arts. 15, 16, and 18(3) and (4) - and he desired us therefrom to draw the inference that the other Articles in which there was no specific reference to Government servants were inapplicable to them. He realised however, that the implication arising from Art. 33 would run counter to this line of argument but as regards this Article his submission was that it was concerned solely to save Army Regulations which permitted detention in a manner which would not be countenanced by Art. 22 of the Constitution. We find ourselves unable to accept the argument that the Constitution excludes Government servants as a class from the protection of the several rights guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III save in those cases where such persons were specifically named.\\n\\n14. In our opinion, this argument even if otherwise possible, has to be repelled in view of the terms of Art. 33. That Article select two of the Services under the State-members of the armed forces charged with the maintenance of public order and saves the rules prescribing the conditions of service in regard to them - Page 12 of 16\\n\\n14. In our opinion, this argument even if otherwise possible, has to be repelled in view of the terms of Art. 33. That Article select two of the Services under the State-members of the armed forces charged with the maintenance of public order and saves the rules prescribing the conditions of service in regard to them - Page 12 of 16\\n\\nfrom invalidity on the ground of violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III and also defines the purpose for which such abrogation or restriction might take place, this being limited to ensure the proper discharge of duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. The Article having thus selected the Services members of which might be deprived of the benefit of the fundamental rights guaranteed to other persons and citizens and also having prescribed the limits within which such restrictions or abrogation might take place, we consider that other classes of servants of Government in common with other persons and other citizens of the country cannot be excluded from the protection of the rights guaranteed by Part III by reason merely of their being Government servants and the nature and incidents of the duties which they have to discharge in that capacity might necessarily involve restrictions of certain freedoms as we have pointed out in relation to Art. 19(1)(e) and (g).”\\n\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n\\n20.\\n\\nA bare consideration of the right of individuals, including public servants, to privacy\\n\\nwould seem to suggest that privacy rights, by virtue of Section 8(1)(j) whenever asserted, would\\n\\nhave to prevail. However, that is not always the case, since the public interest element, seeps\\n\\nthrough that provision. Thus when a member of the public requests information about a public\\n\\nservant, a distinction must be made between “official” information inherent to the position and\\n\\nthose that are not, and therefore affect only his/her private life. This balancing task appears to\\n\\nbe easy; but is in practice, not so, having regard to the dynamics inherent in the conflict.\\n\\nThough it may be justifiably stated that protection of the public servant’s private or personal\\n\\ndetails as an individual, is necessary, provided that such protection does not prevent due\\n\\naccountability, there is a powerful counter argument that public servants must effectively\\n\\nwaive the right to privacy in favour of transparency. Thus, if public access to the personal details\\n\\nsuch as identity particulars of public servants, i.e. details such as their dates of birth, personal\\n\\nidentification numbers, or other personal information furnished to public agencies, is requested, the\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 13 of 16\\n\\nbalancing exercise, necessarily dependant and evolving on case by case basis may take into\\n\\naccount the following relevant considerations, i.e.\\n\\ni) whether the information is deemed to comprise the individual’s private details, unrelated to\\n\\nhis position in the organization, and,\\n\\nii) whether the disclosure of the personal information is with the aim of providing knowledge of\\n\\nthe proper performance of the duties and tasks assigned to the public servant in any specific\\n\\ncase;\\n\\niii) whether the disclosure will furnish any information required to establish accountability or\\n\\ntransparency in the use of public resources.\\n\\n21.\\n\\nAn important and perhaps vital consideration, aside from privacy is the public interest\\n\\nelement, mentioned previously. Section 8(1)(j)’s explicit mention of that concept has to be\\n\\nviewed in the context. In the context of the right to privacy, Lord Denning in his What next in\\n\\nLaw, presciently said that:\\n\\n\"English law should recognise a right to privacy. Any infringement of it should give a cause of action for damages or an injunction as the case may require. It should also recognise a right of confidence for all correspondence and communications which expressly or impliedly are given in confidence. None of these rights is absolute. Each is subject to exceptions. These exceptions are to be allowed whenever the public interest in openness outweighs the public interest in privacy or confidentiality. In every instance it is a balancing exercise for the Courts. As each case is decided, it will form a precedent for others. So a body of case-law will be established.\"\\n\\n22.\\n\\nA private individual’s right to privacy is undoubtedly of the same order as that of a\\n\\npublic servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive rights of the two\\n\\ndiffer. Yet, inherent in the situation of the latter is the premise that he acts for the public good,\\n\\nin the discharge of his duties, and is accountable for them. The character of protection,\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 14 of 16\\n\\ntherefore, which is afforded to the two classes – public servants and private individuals, has to\\n\\nbe viewed from this perspective. The nature of restriction on the right to privacy is therefore of\\n\\na different order; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater;\\n\\nin the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at\\n\\nstake. Therefore, if an important value in public disclosure of personal information is\\n\\ndemonstrated, in the particular facts of a case, the protection afforded by Section 8(1)(j) may\\n\\nnot be available; in such case, the information officer can proceed to the next step of issuing\\n\\nnotice to the concerned public official, as a “third party” and consider his views on why there\\n\\nshould be no disclosure. The onus of showing that disclosure should be made, is upon the\\n\\nindividual asserting it; he cannot merely say that as the information relates to a public official,\\n\\nthere is a public interest element. Adopting such a simplistic argument would defeat the object\\n\\nof Section 8(1)(j); the legislative intention in carving out an exception from the normal rule\\n\\nrequiring no “locus” by virtue of Section 6, in the case of exemptions, is explicit through the\\n\\nnon-obstante clause. The court is also unpersuaded by the reasoning of the Bombay High Court,\\n\\nwhich appears to have given undue, even overwhelming deference to Parliamentary privilege\\n\\n(termed “plenary” by that court) in seeking information, by virtue of the proviso to Section\\n\\n8(1)(j). Were that the true position, the enactment of Section 8(1)(j) itself is rendered\\n\\nmeaningless, and the basic safeguard bereft of content. The proviso has to be only as confined\\n\\nto what it enacts, to the class of information that Parliament can ordinarily seek; if it were held\\n\\nthat all information relating to all public servants, even private information, can be accessed by\\n\\nParliament, Section 8(1)(j) would be devoid of any substance, because the provision makes no\\n\\nW.P.(C) 803/2009\\n\\nPage 15 of 16\\n\\ndistinction between public and private information. Moreover there is no law which enables\\n\\nParliament to demand all such information; it has to be necessarily in the context of some\\n\\nmatter, or investigation. If the reasoning of the Bombay High Court were to be accepted, there\\n\\nwould be nothing left of the right to privacy, elevated to the status of a fundamental right, by\\n\\nseveral judgments of the Supreme Court.\\n\\n23.\\n\\nAs discussed earlier, the “public interest” argument of the Petitioner is premised on the\\n\\nplea that his wife is a public servant; he is in litigation with her, and requires information, - in\\n\\nthe course of a private dispute – to establish the truth of his allegations. The CIC has held that\\n\\nthere is no public interest element in the disclosure of such personal information, in the\\n\\npossession of the information provider, i.e. the Indian Air Force. This court concurs with the\\n\\nview, on an application of the principles discussed. The petitioner has, not been able to justify\\n\\nhow such disclosure would be in “public interest” : the litigation is, pure and simple, a private\\n\\none. The basic protection afforded by virtue of the exemption (from disclosure) enacted under\\n\\nSection 8(1)(j) cannot be lifted or disturbed.\\n\\n24.\\n\\nIn view of the above discussion, the writ petition fails, and is dismissed. In the\\n\\ncircumstances of the case, there shall be no order on costs.\\n\\nS.

The Petitioner Indian Institute of Technology („IIT‟), Delhi is aggrieved\\n\\nby orders dated 23rd November 2010 and 23rd December 2010 passed by the\\n\\nCentral Information Commission („CIC‟) in the complaints of Mr. Navin\\n\\nTalwar [the Respondent in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 747 of 2011) and Mr.\\n\\nSushil Kohli [the Respondent in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 751 of 2011),\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 1 of 7\\n\\nrespectively.\\n\\n2. The issue involved in both these petitions is more or less similar. Mr.\\n\\nNavin Talwar sat for the Joint Entrance Examination 2010 („JEE 2010‟). Mr.\\n\\nSushil Kohli‟s daughter, Ms. Sakshi Kohli, sat for the Graduate Aptitude\\n\\nTest in Engineering 2010 („GATE 2010‟). The scheme of the examination is\\n\\nthat the candidates are given two question papers, containing multiple\\n\\nchoices for the correct answers, the correct answers are to be darkened by a\\n\\npencil in the Optical Response Sheet („ORS‟) which is supplied to the\\n\\ncandidates. The candidate has to darken the bubbles corresponding to the\\n\\ncorrect answer in an ORS against the relevant question number.\\n\\n3. The JEE 2010 was conducted on 11th April 2010 in 1026 centres across\\n\\nIndia and 4.72 lakh candidates appeared. The answer key was placed on the\\n\\ninternet website of the IIT on 3rd June 2010 while the individual marks of the\\n\\ncandidates were posted on 5th June 2010. Counseling of the successful\\n\\ncandidates took place from 9th to 12th June 2010. The GATE 2010 was\\n\\nconducted on 14th February 2010 and the results were announced on 15th\\n\\nMarch 2010.\\n\\n4. In the information brochure, for the JEE, one of the terms and conditions\\n\\nreads as under:\\n\\n“X. Results of JEE-2010\\n\\n1. Performance in JEE-2010\\n\\nThe answer paper of JEE-2010 is a machine-gradable Optical\\n\\nResponse Sheet (ORS). These sheets are scrutinized and graded\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 2 of 7\\n\\nwith extreme care after the examination. There is no provision for\\n\\nre-grading and re-totalling. No photocopies of the machine-\\n\\ngradable sheets will be made available. No correspondence in this\\n\\nregard will be entertained.\\n\\nCandidates will get\\n\\nto know\\n\\ntheir All\\n\\nIndia Ranks\\n\\n(„AIR‟)/Category ranks through our website/SMS/VRS on May\\n\\n26, 2010.\\n\\nCandidates can view their performance in JEE-2010 from JEE\\n\\nwebsites from June 3, 2010.”\\n\\nA similar clause is contained in Clause 3.5.1 (d) of the brochure for GATE.\\n\\n5. It is stated that despite the above condition, Mr. Navin Talwar [the\\n\\nRespondent in W.P. (Civil) No. 747 of 2011] and Mr. Sushil Kohli (father)\\n\\n[the Respondent in W.P. (Civil) No. 751 of 2011] filed applications under\\n\\nthe Right to Information Act, 2005 („RTI Act‟) with the Public Information\\n\\nOfficer („PIO‟), IIT seeking the photocopies of the respective ORSs and for\\n\\nthe subject-wise marks of each of the candidates.\\n\\n6. The PIO of IIT responded by stating that the marks obtained by the\\n\\ncandidates were available on the internet and there was no provision for\\n\\nproviding a photocopy of the ORS. Thereafter, the Respondents filed appeals\\n\\nbefore the CIC. After perusing the response of the PIO, IIT, the CIC passed\\n\\nthe following order in the appeal filed by Mr. Navin Talwar:\\n\\n“3. Upon perusal of the documents of\\n\\nthe case, the\\n\\nCommission finds that the response of the Public Authority is\\n\\nnot found acceptable by the Complainant. Hence, despite the information provided by the letter dated 15th June 2010, the\\n\\nComplainant approached this Commission. The Commission\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 3 of 7\\n\\nsuggests the Complainant to seek inspection of the relevant\\n\\nrecords and directs Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi to\\n\\ncooperate with the Complainant in the inspection of the file/s.\\n\\nIt is also directed that the Respondent shall submit a duly\\n\\nnotarised affidavit on a Non-judicial stamp paper stating the\\n\\ninability to furnish the copy of ORS. The Complainant is at\\n\\nliberty to approach the appropriate Grievance Redressal Forum\\n\\nor seek legal remedy.”\\n\\n7. As regards the case of Mr. Sushil Kohli the Commission found that the\\n\\ndefence of the IIT was that “the information sought is exempted under\\n\\nSection 8 (1) (e) since GATE Committee shares fiduciary relationship with\\n\\nits evaluators and maintains confidentiality of both the manner and method\\n\\nof evaluation.” It was further contended before the CIC that “the evaluation\\n\\nof the ORS is carried out by a computerized process using scanning\\n\\nmachines.” The decision rendered on 23rd December 2010 in the appeal filed\\n\\nby Mr. Sushil Kohli reads as under:\\n\\n“2. During the hearing, the Respondent stated that they have to\\n\\ninform the NCB, MHRD before handing over the marks to the\\n\\nAppellant and that the process would take more than a month.\\n\\nThe Commission in consultation with the Appellant agreed to\\n\\ngive additional time to the PIO for providing the information\\n\\nand accordingly directs the PIO to provide the marks sheet to\\n\\nthe Appellant within 45 days from the date of hearing to the\\n\\nAppellant.”\\n\\n8. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Arjun Mitra, learned counsel\\n\\nappearing for the Petitioner IIT. It is first submitted that as regards Mr.\\n\\nNavin Talwar‟s case, severe prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner\\n\\nbecause the decision of the CIC has been rendered without affording the IIT\\n\\nan opportunity of being heard.\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 4 of 7\\n\\n9. This Court is not impressed with the above submission. The defence the\\n\\nPetitioner may have had, if a notice had been issued to it by the CIC, has\\n\\nbeen considered by this Court in the present proceedings. This Court finds,\\n\\nfor the reasons explained hereinafter, that there is no legal justification for\\n\\nthe Petitioner‟s refusal to provide each of the Respondents a photocopy of\\n\\nthe concerned ORS.\\n\\n10. It is next submitted that under Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act, there is a\\n\\nfiduciary relationship that the Petitioner shares with the evaluators and\\n\\ntherefore a photocopy of the ORS cannot be disclosed. Reliance is placed on\\n\\nthe decision by the Full Bench of the CIC rendered on 23rd April 2007 in\\n\\nRakesh Kumar Singh v. Harish Chander.\\n\\n11. In the first place given the fact that admittedly the evaluation of the ORS\\n\\nis carried out through a computerized process and not manually, the question\\n\\nof there being a fiduciary relationship between the IIT and the evaluators\\n\\ndoes not arise. Secondly, a perusal of the decision of the CIC in Rakesh\\n\\nKumar Singh v. Harish Chander shows that a distinction was drawn by the\\n\\nCIC between the OMR sheets and conventional answer sheets. The\\n\\nevaluation of the ORS is done by a computerized process. The non-ORS\\n\\nanswer sheets are evaluated by physical marking. It was observed in para 41\\n\\nthat where OMR (or ORS) sheets are used, as in the present cases, the\\n\\ndisclosure of evaluated answer sheets was “unlikely to render the system\\n\\nunworkable and as such the evaluated answer sheets in such cases will be\\n\\ndisclosed and made available under the Right to Information Act unless the\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 5 of 7\\n\\nproviding of such answer sheets would involve an infringement of copyright\\n\\nas provided for under Section 9 of the Right to Information Act.”\\n\\n12. Irrespective of the decision dated 23rd April 2007 of the CIC in Rakesh\\n\\nKumar Singh v. Harish Chander, which in any event is not binding on this\\n\\nCourt, it is obvious that the evaluation of the ORS/ORM sheets is through a\\n\\ncomputerized process and no prejudice can be caused to the IIT by providing\\n\\na candidate a photocopy of the concerned ORS. This is not information\\n\\nbeing sought by a third party but by the candidate himself or herself. The\\n\\ndisclosure of such photocopy of the ORS will not compromise the identity of\\n\\nthe evaluator, since the evaluation is done through a computerized process.\\n\\nThere is no question of defence under Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act being\\n\\ninvoked by the IIT to deny copy of such OMR sheets/ORS to the candidate.\\n\\n13. It is then urged by Mr. Mitra that if the impugned orders of the CIC are\\n\\nsustained it would open a “floodgate” of such applications by other\\n\\ncandidates as a result of which the entire JEE and GATE system would\\n\\n“collapse”. The above apprehension is exaggerated. If IIT is confident that\\n\\nboth the JEE and GATE are fool proof, it should have no difficulty\\n\\nproviding a candidate a copy of his or her ORS. It enhances transparency. It\\n\\nappears unlikely that the each and every candidate would want photocopies\\n\\nof the ORS.\\n\\n14. It is then submitted that evaluation done of the ORS by the Petitioner is\\n\\nfinal and no request can be entertained for re-evaluation of marks. Reliance\\n\\nis placed on the order dated 2nd July 2010 passed by the learned Single Judge\\n\\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011\\n\\nPage 6 of 7\\n\\nof this Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3807 of 2010 [Adha Srujana v.\\n\\nUnion of India]. This Court finds that the question as far as the present case\\n\\nis concerned is not about the request of the Respondents for re-evaluation or\\n\\nre-totalling of the marks obtained by them in the JEE 2010 or GATE 2010.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the disclosure of the ORS to the Respondent, IIT would be\\n\\nwithin its rights to decline a request from either of them for re-evaluation or\\n\\nre-totalling in terms of the conditions already set out in the information\\n\\nbrochure. The decision dated 2nd July 2010 by this Court in W.P. (C) No.\\n\\n3807 of 2010 has no application to the present case.\\n\\n15. The right of a candidate, sitting for JEE or GATE, to obtain information\\n\\nunder the RTI Act is a statutory one. It cannot be said to have been waived\\n\\nby such candidate only because of a clause in the information brochure for\\n\\nthe JEE or GATE. In other words, a candidate does not lose his or her right\\n\\nunder the RTI Act only because he or she has agreed to sit for JEE or GATE.\\n\\nThe condition in the brochure that no photocopy of the ORS sheet will be\\n\\nprovided, is subject to the RTI Act. It cannot override the RTI Act.\\n\\n16.

Respondent\\n\\nIn person.\\n\\nCORAM: JUSTICE S. MURALIDHAR\\n\\n%\\n\\nO R D E R 15.12.2010\\n\\n1. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Anti Corruption Branch (‘DCP’) is\\n\\naggrieved by an order dated 25th September 2009 passed by the Central\\n\\nInformation Commission (‘CIC’) directing the Petitioner DCP to provide to\\n\\nthe Respondent copies of the documents sought by him. These documents\\n\\ninclude certified copies of D.D. entry of arrest of the Respondent and various\\n\\nother documents relating to the investigation of the case, under FIR No. 52 of\\n\\n2003. The CIC found the denial of the information by the Petitioner by taking\\n\\nrecourse of Section 8 (1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (‘RTI Act’) to\\n\\nbe untenable. It was held that none of the clauses under Section 8 (1) covered\\n\\nsubjudice matters and therefore, the information could not be denied.\\n\\n2. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Pawan Sharma, learned\\n\\ncounsel appearing for the Petitioner, and the Respondent who appears in\\n\\nW.P. (Civil) 12428/2009\\n\\nPage 1 of 3\\n\\nperson.\\n\\n3. Mr. Pawan Sharma referred to Section 172 (2) of the Code of Criminal\\n\\nProcedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’) and submitted that copies of the case diary can be\\n\\nused by a criminal court conducting the trial and could not be used as\\n\\nevidence in the case. He submitted that even the accused was not entitled, as a\\n\\nmatter of right, to a case diary in terms of Section 172 (2) CrPC and that the\\n\\nprovisions of the RTI Act have to be read subject to Section 172 (2) CrPC.\\n\\nSecondly, it is submitted that the trial has concluded and the Respondent has\\n\\nbeen convicted. All documents relied upon by the prosecution in the trial were\\n\\nprovided to the Respondent under Section 208 CrPC. The Respondent could\\n\\nhave asked for the documents sought by him while the trial was in progress\\n\\nbefore the criminal court. He could not be permitted to invoke the RTI Act\\n\\nafter the conclusion of the trial.\\n\\n4. The Respondent who appears in person does not dispute the fact that the\\n\\ntrial court has convicted him. He states that an appeal has been filed which is\\n\\npending. He submits that his right to ask for documents concerning his own\\n\\ncase in terms of the RTI Act was not subject to any of the provisions of the\\n\\nCrPC. Finally, it is submitted that no prejudice would be caused to the\\n\\nPetitioner at this stage, when the trial itself has concluded if the documents\\n\\npertaining to the investigation are furnished to the Respondent.\\n\\n5. The above submissions have been considered.\\n\\n6. This Court is inclined to concur with the view expressed by the CIC that in\\n\\nW.P. (Civil) 12428/2009\\n\\nPage 2 of 3\\n\\norder to deny the information under the RTI Act the authority concerned\\n\\nwould have to show a justification with reference to one of the specific\\n\\nclauses under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act. In the instant case, the Petitioner\\n\\nhas been unable to discharge that burden. The mere fact that a criminal case is\\n\\npending may not by itself be sufficient unless there is a specific power to deny\\n\\ndisclosure of the information concerning such case. In the present case, the\\n\\ncriminal trial has concluded. Also, the investigation being affected on account\\n\\nof the disclosure information sought by the Respondent pertains to his own\\n\\ncase. No prejudice can be caused to the Petitioner if the D.D. entry concerning\\n\\nhis arrest, the information gathered during the course of the investigation, and\\n\\nthe copies of the case diary are furnished to the Respondent. The right of an\\n\\napplicant to seek such information pertaining to his own criminal case, after\\n\\nthe conclusion of the trial, by taking recourse of the RTI Act, cannot be said\\n\\nto be barred by any provision of the CrPC. It is required to be noticed that\\n\\nSection 22 of the RTI Act states that the RTI Act would prevail\\n\\nnotwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official\\n\\nSecrets Act, 1923 and any other law for the time being in force.\\n\\n7. Consequently, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned\\n\\norder dated 25th September 2009 passed by the CIC.\\n\\n8.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that disclosure of\\n\\ninformation mentioned above is an unwarranted invasion on the\\n\\nright to privacy of the petitioner and is contrary to Section 8(1)(j) of\\n\\nthe Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as Act,\\n\\nfor short).\\n\\n4. Right to privacy has been a subject matter and reiterated in\\n\\nthe State of Andhra Pradesh and District Registrar and\\n\\nCollector, Hyderabad and another versus Canara Bank and\\n\\nothers (2005) 1 SCC 496. However, the said right is not an\\n\\nabsolute right. Right to information is a part of Right to Freedom of\\n\\nSpeech and Expression. Section 8(1)(j) of the Act balances right to\\n\\nprivacy and right to information. It recognizes that both rights are\\n\\nimportant and require protection and in case of conflict between\\n\\nthe two rights, the test of over-riding public interest is applied to\\n\\ndecide whether information should be withheld or disclosed.\\n\\nWPC No.8524/2009\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\n5. Section 8(i)(j) of the Act, stands interpreted by Ravindra Bhat,\\n\\nJ. in The CPIO, Supreme Court of India, Tilak Marg, New Delhi\\n\\nversus Subhash Chandra Agarwal & another (Writ Petition No.\\n\\n288/2009) decided on 2nd September, 2009. It has been held as\\n\\nunder:-\\n\\n“66. It could arguably be said that that privacy rights, by virtue of Section 8(1)(j) whenever asserted, would prevail. However, that is not always the case, since the public interest element, seeps through that provision. Thus when a member of the public requests personal information about a public servant, - such as asset declarations made by him- a distinction must be made between the personal data inherent to the position and those that are not, and therefore affect only his/her private life. This balancing task appears to be easy; but is in practice, not so, having regard to the dynamics inherent in the conflict. If public access to the personal data containing details, like photographs of public servants, personal particulars such as their dates of birth, personal identification numbers, or to public other personal agencies, is requested, the balancing exercise, necessarily dependant and evolving on a case by case basis, would take into account of many factors which would require examination, having regard to circumstances of each case. These may include:\\n\\ninformation\\n\\nfurnished\\n\\ni) whether the disclosure of the personal information is with the aim of providing knowledge of the proper performance of the duties and tasks assigned to the public servant in any specific case;\\n\\nii)whether the information is deemed to comprise the individual ‟s private details, unrelated to his position in the organization, and,\\n\\nWPC No.8524/2009\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\niii) whether furnish any the disclosure will information required to establish accountability or transparency in the use of public resources.\\n\\nof privacy,therefore,has to be viewed in the context. Lord Denning in his “What next in Law ”,presciently to suitably balance the emphasized the need competing values, as follows:\\n\\nSection\\n\\n8(1)(j)‟s\\n\\nexplicit mention\\n\\n\"English law should recognise a right to privacy. Any infringement of it should give a cause of action for damages or an injunction as the case may require. It should also right of confidence for all correspondence and communications which expressly or impliedly are given in confidence. None of these rights is absolute. Each is subject to exceptions. These exceptions are to be allowed whenever the public interest in openness outweighs the public interest in privacy or confidentiality. In every instance it is a balancing exercise for the Courts. As each case is decided, it will form a precedent for others. So a body of case-law will be established.\"\\n\\nrecognise a\\n\\n67. A private citizen ‟s privacy right is undoubtedly of the same nature and character as that of a public servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive rights of the two differ. Yet, inherent in the situation of the latter is the premise that he acts for the public good, in the discharge of his duties, and is accountable for them. The character of protection, therefore, afforded to the two classes – public servants and private individuals, is to be viewed from this perspective. The nature of restriction on the right to privacy is therefore of a different order; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at Page 4\\n\\n67. A private citizen ‟s privacy right is undoubtedly of the same nature and character as that of a public servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive rights of the two differ.

The nature of restriction on the right to privacy is therefore of a different order; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at Page 4\\n\\nstake. Therefore, if an important value in public disclosure of personal information is demonstrated, in the particular facts of a case, by way of objective material or evidence, furnished by the information seeker, the protection afforded by Section 8(1)(j) may not be available; in such case, the information officer can proceed to the next step of issuing notice to the concerned public official,as a “third party ”and consider his views on why there should be no disclosure. The onus of showing that disclosure should be made, is upon the individual asserting it; he cannot merely say that as the information relates to a public official, there is a public interest element. Adopting such a simplistic argument would defeat the objective of Section 8(1)(j); Parliamentary intention in carving out an exception from the normal rule requiring no “locus ” by virtue of Section 6,in the case of exemptions, is explicit through the non-obstante clause.”\\n\\n6.\\n\\nIn the present case, the CIC has applied the same “test of\\n\\npublic interest” to determine and decide whether the information\\n\\nsought should be disclosed or disclosure will amount\\n\\nunwarranted invasion of right to privacy.\\n\\n7. It may be noted here that the information sought for by\\n\\nrespondent no.2 relates to criminal complaints filed against the\\n\\npetitioner, FIRs registered against him, their current status and\\n\\nwhether warrants were issued against some persons, police\\n\\nreports on execution of warrants and their current status. The\\n\\naforesaid information is already as observed by the CIC, part of\\n\\npublic records including court records. It is obvious and admitted\\n\\nWPC No.8524/2009\\n\\nto\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\nthat complaints are pending and FIRs have been registered and\\n\\nthe same have been filed with the criminal court. Issue of arrest\\n\\nwarrants and submissions of reports thereon also form part of the\\n\\ncourt records. It may be relevant to state here that the petitioner\\n\\nhimself has admitted that he has disputes with various parties and\\n\\nlitigations are pending. He has also given details of some of the\\n\\nFIRs registered against him in the Writ Petition itself. It may be\\n\\nappropriate here to reproduce the ratio as expounded by the\\n\\nSupreme Court in Raj Gopal versus State of Andhra Pradesh\\n\\n(1994) 6 SCC 632 which reads as under:\\n\\nA citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, childbearing and education among other matters.\\n\\n“(1)\\n\\n(2) None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent – whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned. But a publication concerning the above aspects becomes unobjectionable, if such publication is based upon public records including court records. Once something becomes a matter of public record, the right of privacy no longer exists. The only exception to this could be in the interest of decency.\\n\\n(3) In the case of public officials, it is obvious that right of privacy or for that matter, remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conducts relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon the acts and statements that are not true unless the official establishes that\\n\\nWPC No.8524/2009\\n\\nPage 6\\n\\nthe publication was made with reckless disregard for truth.\\n\\n(4) So far as the Government, local authority or institution exercising other organization and governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain suit for damages for defaming them.”\\n\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n\\nIn view of the aforesaid, I do not find any merit in the present\\n\\nWrit Petition and the same is dismissed.\\n\\n(SANJIV KHANNA)\\n\\nJUDGE\\n\\nNOVEMBER 4th , 2009.

The view taken by the CPIO was also maintained by the first appellate\\n\\nauthority.\\n\\nBeing aggrieved\\n\\nthe respondent approached\\n\\nthe Central\\n\\nInformation Commission (for short „CIC‟) by way of a second appeal.\\n\\nAllowing the appeal the CIC inter alia held as under:\\n\\nW.P(C) No. 5959 of 2013\\n\\nPage 1 of 3\\n\\n“4. During the hearing, the Respondents reiterated the same arguments. It is a fact that the public authority from which the information has been sought has been included in the second schedule. Ordinarily, the provisions of the Right to Information (RTI) Act would apply to it. However, in terms of first proviso to Section 24 (1) of the RTI Act, all information relating to the allegations of corruption and human rights violation will be provided. In this case, the Appellant, a member of the Schedule Caste alleged that the public authority has been extremely unfair to him in respect of his promotion and that it denied him promotion for a long period of time without explaining him the reasons thereby violating his human right. In the special circumstances, of this case wherein the information seeker is a member of the SC community alleging to have been deprived of his rights in a matter of promotion in the job place, we are inclined to treat this case as covered by the proviso to Section 24 (1) of the RTI Act and allow the information to be disposed. We, therefore, direct the CPIO to provide to the Appellant the desired information within 10 working days from the receipt of this order.”\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBeing aggrieved from the order of the CIC, Directorate General of\\n\\nSecurity, Office of Director, Aviation Research Centre and CPIO of the\\n\\nCabinet Secretariat are before this Court by way of this writ petition.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nSection 24 of the RTI Act to the extent it is relevant reads as under:\\n\\n“24. Act not to apply to certain organizations. – (1) Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the intelligence and security organisations specified in the Second Schedule, being organisations established by the Central Government or any information furnished by such organisations to that Government.\\n\\nProvided that the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights violations shall not be excluded under this sub-section:”\\n\\n4.\\n\\nA perusal of the Second Schedule which enumerates the intelligence\\n\\nand security organisations established by the Central Government which are\\n\\nin Section 24 of the Act would show that Aviation Research Centre is\\n\\nW.P(C) No. 5959 of 2013\\n\\nPage 2 of 3\\n\\nincluded in the said list at serial No.7. Admittedly the respondent was\\n\\nworking in the Aviation Research Centre only. Therefore, the provisions of\\n\\nthe RTI Act would not apply to the aforesaid organisation except in the\\n\\nmatters relating to allegations of corruption and human rights violation. The\\n\\ninformation sought by the petitioner pertained to various DPCs held from\\n\\n2000 to 2009 and such information is neither an information related to\\n\\nallegations of corruption nor to human rights violation. No violation of\\n\\nhuman rights is involved in service matters, such as promotion, disciplinary\\n\\nactions, pay increments, retiral benefits, pension, gratuity, etc. The\\n\\nCommission, therefore, was clearly wrong in directing supply of said\\n\\ninformation to the respondent.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nFor the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned order dated 29.3.2011\\n\\nof the CIC is quashed.

[Civil Appeal No.6454 of 2011] and the\\n\\nfollowing view was taken:\\n\\n21. The term `fiduciary\\' refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term `fiduciary relationship\\' is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or transaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party. There are also certain relationships where both the parties have to act in a fiduciary capacity the beneficiary. the other as Examples of these are: a partner vis-`-vis another partner and an employer vis-`-vis employee.

Similarly, if on the request of the employer or official superior or the head of a department, an employee furnishes his personal details and information, to be retained in confidence, the employer, the official superior or departmental head is expected to hold such personal information in confidence as a fiduciary, to be made use of or disclosed only if the employee\\'s conduct or acts are found to be prejudicial to the employer.\\n\\n22. ...the words `information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship\\' are used in section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act in its normal and well recognized sense, that is to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the actions of the fiduciary - a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically/infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a patient, an agent with reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another partner, a director of a company with reference to a share-holder, an executor with reference to a legatee, a receiver with reference to the parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business dealings/transaction of the employer. ..” Page 7 of 15\\n\\n22. ...the words `information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship\\' are used in section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act in its normal and well recognized sense, that is to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the actions of the fiduciary - a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically/infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a patient, an agent with reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another partner, a director of a company with reference to a share-holder, an executor with reference to a legatee, a receiver with reference to the parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business dealings/transaction of the employer. ..” Page 7 of 15\\n\\nThe aforesaid expression also came up for consideration of the\\n\\nApex Court in Bihar Public Service Commission versus Saiyed Hussain\\n\\nAbbas Rizwi & Anr. [Civil Appeal No.9052 of 2012] and the following\\n\\nview was taken by the Apex Court:\\n\\n“22....The term „fiduciary‟ refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term „fiduciary relationship‟ is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person places complete confidence in another person in regard to his affairs, business or transactions. This aspect has been discussed in some detail in the judgment of this Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education (supra). xxx 24...The information may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity...”\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe advice from UPSC is taken by the Disciplinary Authority, as\\n\\na statutory requirement under the service rules applicable to an\\n\\nemployee and wherever the Disciplinary Authority takes such an advice\\n\\ninto consideration while recording its findings in the matter. The\\n\\nconcerned employee is entitled to supply of such advice to him, as a\\n\\nmatter of right. There is no relationship of master and agent or a client\\n\\nand advocate between the UPSC and the department which seeks its\\n\\nadvice. The information which the department provides to UPSC for the\\n\\npurpose of obtaining its advice normally would be the information\\n\\npertaining to the employee against whom disciplinary proceedings have\\n\\nbeen initiated. Ordinarily such information would already be available\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 8 of 15\\n\\nwith the concerned employee having been supplied to him while seeking\\n\\nhis explanation, along with the charge-sheet or during the course of the\\n\\ninquiry. The UPSC, while giving its advice, cannot take into\\n\\nconsideration any material, which is not available or is not to be made\\n\\navailable to the concerned employee. Therefore, the notings of the\\n\\nofficials of UPSC, would contain nothing, except the information which\\n\\nis already made available or is required to be made available to the\\n\\nconcerned employee. Sometimes, such information can be a third party\\n\\ninformation, which qualifies to be personal information, within the\\n\\nmeaning of clause (j), but, such information, can always be excluded,\\n\\nwhile responding to an application made to UPSC, under RTI Act.\\n\\nTherefore, when such information is sought by none other than the\\n\\nemployee against whom disciplinary proceedings are sought to be\\n\\ninitiated or are held, it would be difficult to accept the contention that\\n\\nthere is a fiduciary relationship between UPSC and the department\\n\\nseeking its advice or that the information pertaining to such an employee\\n\\nis held by UPSC in trust. Such a plea, in my view, can be taken only\\n\\nwhen the information is sought by someone other than the employee to\\n\\nwhom the information pertains.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the decision\\n\\nof this Court in Ravinder Kumar versus CIC [LPA No.418/2008\\n\\n3.5.2011. The aforesaid LPA arose out of a decision of the learned\\n\\nSingle Judge of this Court in W.P(C) No.2269/2011 decided on\\n\\n5.4.2011, upholding the directions of the Commission to UPSC to\\n\\nprovide photocopies of the relevant file notings concerning of two\\n\\ndisciplinary cases involving the respondent to him, after deleting the\\n\\nname and other reference to the individual officer/ authority. As noted\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 9 of 15\\n\\nby a learned Single Judge of this Court in UPSC versus R.K. Jain\\n\\n[W.P(C) No.1243/2011 dated 13.7.2012, the order passed by the\\n\\nDivision Bench was an order dismissing the application for restoration\\n\\nof the LPA and was not an order on merit and, therefore, it was not a\\n\\ndecision on any legal proposition rendered by the Court on merit. It was\\n\\nfurther held that mere prima facie observation of the Division Bench\\n\\ndoes not constitute a binding precedent. Therefore, reliance upon the\\n\\naforesaid order in LPA No.418/2010 is wholly misplaced.\\n\\n10. As regards the applicability of clause (g), it would be seen that the\\n\\nsaid clause exempts information of two kinds from disclosure – the first\\n\\nbeing the information disclosure of which would endanger the life or\\n\\nphysical safety of any person and second being the information which\\n\\nwould identify the source of information or assistance given in\\n\\nconfidence for law enforcement or security purposes. The two parts of\\n\\nthe clause are independent of each other – meaning thereby that\\n\\nexemption from disclosure on account of danger to the life or physical\\n\\nsafety of any person can be ground of exemption irrespective of who\\n\\nhad given the information, who was the person, to whom the\\n\\ninformation was given, what was the purpose of giving information and\\n\\nwhat were the terms – expressed or implied subject to which the\\n\\ninformation was provided. The aforesaid clause came up for\\n\\nconsideration before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service\\n\\nCommission(supra) and the following view was taken:\\n\\n“28...The legislature, in its wisdom, has used two distinct expressions. They cannot be read or construed as being synonymous. Every expression used by the Legislature must be given its intended meaning and, in fact, a purposeful interpretation. The expression „life‟ has to be construed liberally. „Physical safety‟ is a\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 10 of 15\\n\\nrestricted term while life is a term of wide connotation. „Life‟ includes reputation of an individual as well as the right to live with freedom. The expression „ life‟ also appears in Article 21 of the Constitution and has been provided a wide meaning so as to inter alia include within its ambit the right to live with dignity, right to shelter, right to basic needs and even the right to reputation. The expression life under section 8(1(g) the Act, thus, has to be understood in somewhat similar dimensions. The „endanger‟ or „endangerment‟ means the act or an instance of putting someone or something in danger; exposure to peril or such situation which would hurt the concept of life as understood in its wider sense [refer Black‟s Law Dictionary (Eighth Edition)]. Of course, physical safety would mean the likelihood of assault to physical existence of a person. If in the opinion of the concerned authority life or possibility of danger to physical safety, the State Information Commission would be entitled to bring such case within the exemption of Section 8(1)(g) of the Act. The disclosure of information which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person is one category and identification of the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes is another category. The expression „for law enforcement or security purposes‟ is to be read ejusdem generis only to the expression „assistance given in confidence‟ and not to any other clause of the section. On the plain reading of Section 8(1)(g), it becomes clear that the said clause is complete in itself. It cannot be said to have any reference to the expression „assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes‟. Neither the language of the Section nor the object of the Section requires such interpretation.”\\n\\nterm\\n\\nthere\\n\\nis danger\\n\\nto\\n\\n11.\\n\\nIn my view, the apprehension of the petitioner that if the identity\\n\\nof the author of the file notings is revealed by his name, designation or\\n\\nin any other manner, there is a possibility of such an employee being\\n\\ntargeted, harassed and even intimidated by the persons against whom an\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 11 of 15\\n\\nadverse noting is recorded by him on the file of UPSC, is fully justified.\\n\\nThough, ultimately it is for the members of the UPSC who are to accept\\n\\nor reject such notings, this can hardly be disputed that the notings do\\n\\nplay a vital role in the advice which UPSC ultimately renders to the\\n\\nconcerned department. Therefore, the person against whom an adverse\\n\\nadvice is given may hold the employee of UPSC recording a note\\n\\nadverse to him on the file, responsible for an adverse advice given by\\n\\nUPSC against him and may, therefore, harass and sometime even harm\\n\\nsuch an employee/officer of UPSC, directly or indirectly. To this extent,\\n\\nthe officers of UPSC need to be protected. However, the purpose can be\\n\\nfully achieved by blocking the name, designation or any other indication\\n\\nwhich would disclose or tend to disclose the identity of the author of the\\n\\nnoting. Denying the notings altogether would not be justified when the\\n\\nintended objective can be fully achieved by adopting such safeguards.\\n\\n12. Personal Information\\n\\nAs regards clause (j), it would be difficult to dispute that the\\n\\nexemption cannot be claimed when the information is sought by none\\n\\nother than the person to whom the personal information relates. It is\\n\\nonly when the information is sought by a third party that such an\\n\\nexemption can be claimed by UPSC. If, the notings recorded on the file\\n\\nand/or the correspondence exchanged between UPSC and the concerned\\n\\ndepartment do contain any such information which pertains to a person\\n\\nother than the information seeker and constitutes personal information\\n\\nwithin the meaning of section 8(1)(j), the UPSC was certainly be\\n\\nentitled to refuse such information on the ground that it is exempted\\n\\nfrom disclosure under clause 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 12 of 15\\n\\n13. As regards the contention that the notings recorded by the\\n\\nemployees of UPSC are not necessary for the information seeker since\\n\\nhe is concerned with the ultimate opinion rendered by UPSC to his\\n\\ndepartment and not with various notings which are recorded by the\\n\\nofficer of the Commission, I find the same to be devoid of any merit.\\n\\nWhile seeking information under the Right to Information Act, the\\n\\napplication is not required to disclose the purpose for which the\\n\\ninformation is sought nor is it necessary for him to satisfy the CPIO that\\n\\nthe information sought by him was necessary for his personal purposes\\n\\nor for public purpose. Therefore, the question whether information\\n\\nseeker really needs the information is not relevant in the Scheme of the\\n\\nAct. The learned counsel for the petitioner drew my attention to the\\n\\nfollowing observations made by the Apex Court in Central Board of\\n\\nSecondary Education and Another versus Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors.\\n\\n(supra):\\n\\n“37. The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to information are intended to be formidable tools in the hands of responsible citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and accountability. The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced strictly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging corruption. But in regard to other information,(that is information other than those enumerated in section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act), equal importance and emphasis are given interests (like confidentiality of to other public fiduciary sensitive\\n\\ninformation,\\n\\nfidelity\\n\\nand\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions\\n\\nPage 13 of 15\\n\\nrelationships, efficient operation of governments, etc.). Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry and information accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counter- productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a the national development and tool integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of in public authorities spends 75% of collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising `information furnishing\\', at the cost of their normal and regular duties.”\\n\\n(unrelated\\n\\ntransparency\\n\\nto\\n\\nto obstruct\\n\\nits citizens.

Respondent Through Mr. Prashant Bhushan with Mr. Pranav Sachdeva, Advocate\\n\\nCORAM: JUSTICE S.MURALIDHAR\\n\\nO R D E R 29.09.2010\\n\\n1. The challenge in this petition is to an order dated 14th September 2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (?CIC?) allowing the appeal filed by the Respondent and directing the information sought by the Respondent to be provided to him by the Petitioner by 5th October 2009 by using the severance clause 10 (1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (?RTI Act?).\\n\\n2. The Respondent filed an application with the Ministry of External Affairs (?MEA?) on 16th September 2008 about the action taken report (?ATR?) on a complaint made to the Central Vigilance Commission (?CVC?) on 13th April 2007. Apparently the said complaint was forwarded by the CVC to the Central Vigilance Officer (?CVO?), MEA. The CVO submitted the ATR to the CVC on 24th July 2007. In this connection, the Respondent requested certified copies of the following documents: ?(a) copies of all departmental notings including recorded by CVO/Inquiry Officer/Cadre Controlling Authority/Disciplinary Authority/any other official(s), if any.\\n\\n(b) copies of all correspondences between Department and alleged officer(s)/other officer(s) pertaining to the matter but excluding copies of complaint.\\n\\n(c) copies of all notes recorded upon oral inquiry.?\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\n1/5\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\n3. On 11th November 2008 the Central Public Information Officer (?CPIO?), MEA wrote to the Respondent declining the information under Section 8(i)(j) of the RTI Act. The first appeal filed by the Respondent was rejected by the Appellate Authority of the MEA on 5th October 2008, concurring with the reasoning of the CPIO. The Respondent then filed a second appeal before the CIC.\\n\\n4. Before the CIC the Respondent explained that the complaint was about certain incidents of alleged misuse of government money in the Embassy of India, Ankara, Turkey in March 2007. The Respondent had come to know that in the ATR submitted, the CPIO had held that most of the allegations were baseless and that some procedural error might have occurred but without any financial loss to the Government. The CPIO accordingly opined that the matter should be closed by the CVC. On the basis of the ATR, the CVC decided not to further proceed with the matter. The Respondent urged that it was a right of a citizen to know the action the concerned public authority had taken on the complaint made to it.\\n\\n5. At the hearing on 18th May 2009, the CIC held that there was no merit in the CPIO?s denial of information as ?personal information? by invoking Section 8 (1)(j) of the RTI Act since ?the public interest in this case far outweighs any harm done to protected interests.? Accordingly, the CPIO was directed to provide all the information sought by the Respondent in his RTI application by 15th June 2009 under intimation to the Commission.\\n\\n6. Thereafter, the CIC received a letter dated 15th June 2009 from the CPIO, MEA seeking review of its order 18th May 2009 in view of the objection raised by the ?Third Party? i.e. the Ambassador of India at Turkey during the relevant time. The MEA invoked the provisions of Section 11 of the RTI Act. Notice was sent to the Ambassador for the hearing on 17th August 2009. On that hearing the CVO file containing the enquiry report and other relevant documents were brought in a sealed cover to the office of the CIC. These were inspected by the Commissioner and returned to the representative of the MEA. The Ambassador was heard by the CIC on 28th August 2009. She also produced a few documents before the CIC clarifying the complaint against her and about the outcome of the investigation.\\n\\n7. It was contended before the CIC by the representative of the MEA that since the information sought related to a case which had been closed after completion of the enquiry, the disclosure of the information sought would indicate ?lack of confidence in the investigations conducted by the MEA and the CVC.? The CIC rejected this contention on the ground that ?neither the RTI Act 2005 nor any other law in force in India states that information pertaining to a closed case cannot be disclosed.?\\n\\n8. Thereafter, the CIC in the impugned order has set out the observations upon the inspection of the enquiry report and the notings from the file of the CVO. Most of the allegations have been found to be baseless and therefore, with the approval of the Foreign Secretary, and in view of the categorical report from the CVO, the CVC concurred in not pursuing the matter further. According to the 2/5\\n\\n8. Thereafter, the CIC in the impugned order has set out the observations upon the inspection of the enquiry report and the notings from the file of the CVO. Most of the allegations have been found to be baseless and therefore, with the approval of the Foreign Secretary, and in view of the categorical report from the CVO, the CVC concurred in not pursuing the matter further. According to the 2/5\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\nenquiry report, there were administrative procedural lapses, which however had not led to any loss to the government. Nevertheless, the same had been noted by the concerned officials for rectification and future compliance.\\n\\n9. The impugned order of the CIC also notes that the CVO file was once again perused by the CIC on 28th August 2009. The observations of the CIC on the further examination are as under: ?The contents of the CVO file inspected by the Commission clearly indicate that the information therein are not by any stretch of imagination ?personal information? pertaining to the Ambassador. The allegations cast as well as the inquiry/investigation conducted were related to the Ambassador in her ?official capacity? and dealt with alleged complaints about misappropriation of government money. The transactions with respect to government money is anyway liable for a government audit, which has been noted even during the investigation by various officials, so there can be no confidentiality and/or secrecy in divulging such information since the expenditure of government money by a government official in the official capacity as office expenses cannot be termed/categorized as ?personal information?.\\n\\n10. An apprehension was expressed by the MEA before the CIC that:\\n\\n?the disclosure of such classified information could adversely impact the morale of the members of the Ministry. The Respondent expressed his apprehension that the distortion and/or improper reporting of the order declaring such disclosure of information, by the media, in order to make the same sensational, may damage the image and reputation of such a senior official as well as the Ministry. Hence the Ministry, the Commission from disclosure of the information categorizing the said information as ?personal information?.\\n\\n11. The CIC negatived this apprehension by observing that :\\n\\n?In the instant case the disclosure of information relating to alleged charges of corruption and misappropriation of government money, wherein after a detailed investigation/ inquiry, the name and reputation of the public official concerned, had been declared unblemished, is actually crucial in strengthening the public faith in the functioning of the Ministry and the CVC. Since the allegation and/or complaint, vigilance enquiry and the enquiry reports were in respect of the Ambassador in her official capacity and related to her office and acts/omissions therein and also because all the information sought by the Appellant exists in official records already, hence the information cannot be classified as personal nor exemption be sought on that ground.?\\n\\n12. As far as the distortion of the CIC orders in the hands of the media is concerned, it was held that it could not be a ground for not disclosing the information. The CIC specifically dealt with the aspect of public interest in ordering disclosure of information pertaining to a third party under Section 11 of the RTI Act. The CIC observed as under:\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\n3/5\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\n?In this contention it is important to remember that the public interest has to be established in case the information sought otherwise merits non-disclosure, falling within one of the exempted categories and not vice versa. It has amply been discussed in the foregoing paragraphs that since the information sought relates to allegations of misappropriation of government money, public money being at stake, the information cannot be considered as personal information and hence the information does not fall under provisions of Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act 2005.?\\n\\n13. Consequently, the CIC directed that:\\n\\n?the information as sought by the Appellant be provided by 5th October 2009, while using the severance clause 10 (1) of the RTI Act, if required, to severe parts exempted from disclosure in the enquiry report, under intimation to the Commission.?\\n\\n14. The submissions of Mr. Abhinav Rao, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner and Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel for the Respondent have been heard.\\n\\n15. Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Information Commission 2010 VI AD (Delhi) 669 it was submitted by Mr. Rao that the defence of privacy in a case like the present one cannot be lightly brushed aside and that in the present case the rights of the Ambassador against whom the complaint was made outweighed the public interest in ordering disclosure.\\n\\n16. This Court is unable to accept the above submission. The judgment in Arvind Kejriwal was in the context of the information seeker wanting copy of the ACRs of Government officers from the level of Joint Secretary and above. The CIC in this context directed disclosure without even considering the applicability of Section 11 of the RTI Act. It was in the above context that this Court observed that where the information sought related to a third party the procedure under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act could not be dispensed with. Consequently, the appeals filed by Mr. Kejriwal were restored to the file of the CIC for compliance with the procedure outlined under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n17. In the present case, as has been noticed hereinbefore, on a request of the MEA to review its order on the basis of Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act, the matter was heard on 25th August 2009 and 28th August 2009 and notice was issued to the Ambassador for personal hearing on 28h August 2009. The Ambassador was heard by the CIC. It was after carrying out this exercise under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act that the CIC came to the conclusion that the public interest in disclosure of the information sought outweighed any right to privacy claimed by the Ambassador. Therefore, the decision in Arvind Kejriwal is of no assistance to the Petitioner. 18. It was then submitted that once on perusal of the records, the CIC itself came to the conclusion that most of the allegations made in the complaint were\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\n4/5\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010\\n\\nfound to be baseless, there was no justification in directing disclosure of such report.\\n\\n19. This Court would like to observe that where, upon enquiry, it has been found that the allegations made in the complaint were baseless and that the matter did not require to be enquired any further, such a report can hardly be said to be a document the disclosure of which would violate any privacy right of the person complained against. This Court concurs with the observations of the CIC that in the circumstances the information sought was not personal to the Ambassador. The complaint itself is about matters relating to her in an official capacity. The information on the expenditure of government money by a government official in an official capacity cannot be termed as ?personal information?.\\n\\n20. This Court is satisfied that after a detailed examination of the report of the CVO and notings on the file, the CIC has come to the correct conclusion that the public interest in ordering disclosure outweighed any claim to the contrary with reference to Section 11 (1) read with Section 8 (1)(j) of the RTI Act. This Court notices that the CIC has also exercised a degree of caution in permitting the MEA to use Section 10 (1) of the RTI Act and if so required, severe those parts which might compromise the sources of the MEA. The procedure followed by the CIC with reference to Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act and its reasoning cannot be faulted. The apprehension expressed before the CIC about the possible misuse of the information by the Respondent was also expressed before this Court. No authority can proceed on the assumption that an information ordered to be disclosed will be misused. The mere expression of an apprehension of possible misuse of information cannot justify non-disclosure of information.\\n\\n21. This Court finds no ground having made out for interference with the impugned order of the CIC.\\n\\n22. The writ petition and the pending application are dismissed.\\n\\nS.

JAIN, J.\\n\\nThe respondent Yashpal applied to the CPIO of the petitioner-\\n\\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), seeking the following\\n\\ninformation:-\\n\\n“1. Certified copy of the call details of the following numbers. Call details should include incoming as well as outgoing details. Registration details of the following numbers (name, address, date of activation, etc).\\n\\na) 9210023535 (From April 2006- till date). b) 9716682799 (From April 2009- till date). c) 011-26215249 (From April 2005- till date)\\n\\n2.

Being aggrieved, the respondent preferred the Second Appeal\\n\\nbefore the Central information Commissioner (hereinafter referred to as\\n\\n„the Commission‟). Vide impugned order dated 29.12.2011, the\\n\\nCommission directed the petitioner to write to the Service Provider\\n\\nconcerned in exercise of its power under Section 12(1) of the TRAI Act,\\n\\n1997, call for the requisite information subject to its availability with the\\n\\nService Provider and pass on the same to the respondent. Being\\n\\naggrieved from the aforesaid direction, the petitioner is before this Court\\n\\nby way of this writ petition.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTwo issues primarily arise for consideration in this petition; the\\n\\nfirst being as to whether the information sought by the respondent, if\\n\\navailable with the Service Provider can be accessed by the petitioner in\\n\\nexercise of the powers conferred upon it by Section 12(1) of TRAI Act\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 2 of 8\\n\\nand secondly whether the information sought by the respondent is exempt\\n\\nfrom disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nSection 2(f) of the Right to Information Act defines „Information‟\\n\\nto mean, inter alia, any information relating to any private body which\\n\\ncan be accessed by Public Authority under any law for the time being in\\n\\nforce. Section 12(1) of the TRAI Act, 1997 empowers the said Authority,\\n\\nif considered expedient by it to do so, inter alia, to call upon any Service\\n\\nProvider to furnish in writing such information or explanation relating to\\n\\nits affairs as the Authority may require. The functions of the Authority\\n\\nare prescribed in Section 11 of the aforesaid Act. I find merit in the\\n\\ncontention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the power to call\\n\\nfor information or explanation from the Service Provider can be exercised\\n\\nby the Authority only if such information or explanation is required for\\n\\ndischarge of the functions assigned to it. The aforesaid power, in my\\n\\nview, cannot be exercised for the purposes which are alien to the\\n\\nfunctions of the Authority specified in Section 11 of the Act. Taking a\\n\\ncontrary view will lead to the Authority assuming unbridled power to call\\n\\nfor information from a Service Provider irrespective of whether such\\n\\ninformation is necessary for an efficient discharge of the functions\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 3 of 8\\n\\nassigned to the Authority or not. To provide information in respect of the\\n\\nsubscribers of mobile telephones such as their names and addresses, their\\n\\ncall details and copies of the SMSs sent by them certainly are not\\n\\namongst the functions assigned to the Authority under Section 11 of the\\n\\nAct. The Authority was established primarily for the purpose of\\n\\nregulating\\n\\nthe\\n\\ntelecommunication services, adjudicating disputes,\\n\\nprotecting the interests of service providers and consumers of telecom\\n\\nsectors and to promote and ensure orderly growth of the said sector.\\n\\nProviding information of the above-referred nature is not one of the\\n\\npurposes for which Authority was constituted.\\n\\nMoreover, the\\n\\ninformation under Section 12(1) can be sought only in relation to the\\n\\naffairs of the Service Provider and not the affairs of a subscriber to\\n\\ntelecom services. The call details of the subscriber and the SMSs sent by\\n\\nhim is an information relating to the affairs of the subscriber and to the\\n\\naffairs of the Authority. If I take the view that an information of this\\n\\nnature can be requisitioned by TRAI, that would result in a situation\\n\\nwhere the Authority is able to violate with impunity the fundamental right\\n\\nof a citizen to his privacy by knowing with whom he has been\\n\\ncommunicating as well as the contents of the messages sent by him.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 4 of 8\\n\\nTherefore, in my view, the information which the respondent had\\n\\nsought from the CPIO of the petitioner cannot be accessed by the\\n\\npetitioner in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by Section 12(1) of\\n\\nthe TRAI Act, 1997.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nEven if I proceed on the assumption that the information which the\\n\\nrespondent had sought from the petitioner can be obtained by TRAI from\\n\\nthe Service Provider in exercise of the power conferred upon it by Section\\n\\n12(1) of the Act, being personal information of the subscriber, who is a\\n\\nthird party, and its disclosure having no relationship to any public activity\\n\\nor interest of the subscriber and also because its disclosure would cause\\n\\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the subscriber, it is exempt from\\n\\ndisclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe question as to what constitutes „personal information‟ under\\n\\nSection 8(1) (j) and to what extent it is protected, if it relates to a third\\n\\nparty came up for consideration before this Court in W.P.(C) No.\\n\\n3444/2012, Union of India vs. Hardev Singh decided on 23.8.2013 and\\n\\nthe following view was taken:-\\n\\n“It would thus be seen that if the information sought by the applicant is a personal information relating to a third party, it cannot be disclosed, unless the information relates to any public activity\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 5 of 8\\n\\nof a third party who has provided the said information or it is in public interest to disclose the information desired by the applicant. It further shows that a personal information cannot at all be disclosed if its disclosure would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the third party which has provided the said information, unless the larger public interest justifies such disclosure.\\n\\nIn UPSC versus R.K. Jain [W.P(C) No.1243/2011] decided on\\n\\n13.7.2012 the following view was taken by this Court:\\n\\n“19. Therefore, “personal information” under the Act, would be information, as set forth above, that pertains to a person. As such it takes into its fold possibly every kind of information relating to the person. Now, such personal information of the person may, or may not, have relation to any public activity, or to public interest. At the same time, such personal information may, or may not, be private to the person.\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n“Public activity‟ qua a person are those activities 24. which are performed by the person in discharge of a public duty, i.e. in the public domain. There is an inherent public interest involved in the discharge of such activities, as all public duties are expected to be discharged in public interest. Consequently, information of a person which is related to, or has a bearing on his public activities, is not exempt from disclosure under the scheme and provisions of the Act, whose primary object is to ensure an informed citizenry and transparency of information and also to contain corruption. For example, take the case of a surgeon in a Government Hospital who performs employed surgeries on his patients who are coming to the government hospital. His personal information, relating to discharge of his public duty, i.e. his public activity, is not exempt from disclosure under the Act.\\n\\n27.... whenever the querist applicant wishes to seek information, the disclosure of which can be made only\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 6 of 8\\n\\nupon existence of certain special circumstances, for example- the existence of public interest, the querist should in the application (moved under Section 6 of the Act) disclose/ plead the special circumstance, so that the PIO concerned can apply his mind to it, and, in case he decides to issue notice to the concerned third party under Section 11 of the Act, the third party is able to effectively deal with the same. Only then the PIO/appellate authority/CIC would be able to come to an informed decision whether, or not, the special circumstances exist in a given case.\\n\\n28. I may also observe that public interest does not mean that which is interesting as gratifying curiosity or love of information or amusement; but that in which a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their rights or liabilities are affected... xxx\\n\\n34. It follows that the „privacy‟ of a person, or in other words his “private information‟, encompasses the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, child rearing and of the like nature. “Personal information”, on the other hand, as aforesaid, would be information, in any form, that pertains to an individual. Therefore, „private information‟ is a part of “personal information‟. All that is private is personal, but all that is personal may not be private.”\\n\\n6. With whom a subscriber communicates and what messages he\\n\\nsends or receives are the personal affairs of a subscriber, disclosure of\\n\\nwhich is bound to impinge on his privacy. The information sought by the\\n\\nrespondent, therefore, was personal information of a third party, exempt\\n\\nfrom disclosure under Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nDuring the course of hearing the respondent, who appeared in\\n\\nperson, expressed a grievance that he is being harassed by his daughter-\\n\\nin-law and the information sought by him was required in connection\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 7 of 8\\n\\nwith various cases instituted by her against him. If that be so, the\\n\\nappropriate remedy available to the respondent would be either to\\n\\napproach the concerned investigating agency, which is looking into the\\n\\ncomplaint made against him or to apply to the concerned Court at an\\n\\nappropriate stage, for summoning the record of the Service Provider. The\\n\\nrespondent expressed an apprehension that by the time his matter reaches\\n\\nthe Court, the information required by him may no more be available\\n\\nwith the Service Provider since such information is preserved for a\\n\\nlimited period. If that be so, the respondent can avail such remedy as is\\n\\nopen to him in law for a suitable direction to the Service Provider in this\\n\\nregard, but, seeking such an information under the provisions of Right to\\n\\nInformation Act is certainly not an appropriate relief.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nFor the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order dated\\n\\n29.12.2011 passed by the Commission cannot be sustained and the same\\n\\nis hereby set aside. The writ petition stands disposed of. No order as to\\n\\ncosts.\\n\\nV.K.JAIN, J\\n\\nOCTOBER 25, 2013 bg\\n\\nW.P.(C) 2794/2012\\n\\nPage 8 of 8\\n\\n30 $~ *\\n\\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\n+ W.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nTHDC INDIA LTD\\n\\n.....

The present writ petition has been filed challenging the order dated 04th January, 2013 passed by the Central Information Commission (for short „CIC‟) whereby the petitioner has been directed to provide photocopies of\\n\\nthe DPC proceedings\\n\\nincluding\\n\\nthe comparative grading statement\\n\\npertaining to the recommended candidates as well as ACRs of the appellant\\n\\nhimself for the period mentioned by him in his RTI application.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe relevant portion of\\n\\nthe\\n\\nimpugned order\\n\\nis reproduced\\n\\nhereinbelow:-\\n\\n―4. We have carefully considered the contents of the RTI application and the response of the CPIO. The objective of the Right to Information (RTI) Act is to bring about\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 1 of 10\\n\\ntransparency in the functioning of the public authorities. All decision making in the government and all its undertakings must be objective and transparent. It is only by placing the details of all decision making in the public domain that such objectivity and transparency can be ensured. Therefore, we do not see any reason why the DPC proceedings, specially, the comparative gradings of for promotion should not be those recommended disclosed. It is not at all correct to claim that such information is held in a fiduciary capacity. After all, the DPC operates as a part of the administrative decision making process in any organisation. The material that it considers is also generated within the organisation. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the DPC proceedings including the recommendations made by it can be said to be held by the public authority in a fiduciary capacity. About the ACRs of the Appellant, the Supreme Court of India has already held that the civilian employees must be allowed access to their confidential rolls, specially when these are held out against them in the matter of their career promotion. Following the Supreme Court order, the Department of Personnel and Training, we understand, has already issued a circular for disclosure of ACR.‖\\n\\n3. Mr. Neeraj Malhotra, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\\n\\nthe impact of the impugned order passed by CIC is that the petitioner would\\n\\nbe required to give information pertaining to DPC proceedings including the\\n\\ncomparative grading statement pertaining to the recommended candidates,\\n\\nwhich information is excluded under the provisions of Sections 8(1)(e) and\\n\\n8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. He emphasizes that the information directed to be\\n\\nreleased pertaining to other employees of the petitioner is being held by the\\n\\npetitioner in fiduciary capacity and would amount to disclosure of personal\\n\\ninformation.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 2 of 10\\n\\n4.\\n\\nSections 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act are reproduced\\n\\nhereinbelow:-\\n\\n“8. Exemption from disclosure of information. —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,—\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n(e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\\n\\nProvided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.‖\\n\\n5. Mr. Malhotra also submits that as some of the information sought for\\n\\npertains to third party, provisions of Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act\\n\\nwould be applicable. Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act are reproduced\\n\\nhereinbelow:-\\n\\n―11. Third party information.—(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 3 of 10\\n\\ninformation or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information:\\n\\nProvided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party.\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n19. Appeal.- xxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n(4) If the decision of the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, against which an appeal is preferred relates to information of a third party, the Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the case may be, shall give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to that third party.‖\\n\\n6.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Mr. Saini, learned counsel for the respondent\\n\\nsubmits that it is difficult to comprehend that any public interest would be\\n\\nserved by denying information to the respondent with regard to DPC\\n\\nproceedings including the comparative grading statements pertaining to the\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 4 of 10\\n\\nrecommended candidates as also photocopy of respondent‟s ACR containing\\n\\nthe remarks of the reporting and the reviewing officers as well as accepting\\n\\nauthority.\\n\\n7. Mr. Saini points out that the respondent himself is a Government\\n\\nservant working in the same corporation and was considered by the selection\\n\\ncommittee for promotion in the said DPC proceedings. Hence, according to\\n\\nhim, the respondent has a right to seek information regarding DPC\\n\\nproceedings including the comparative grading statements pertaining to the\\n\\nrecommended candidates.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nIn support of his submission, Mr. Saini relies upon a judgment of the\\n\\nSupreme Court in Dev Dutt v. Union of India and Others (2008) 8 SCC\\n\\n725 wherein it has been held as under:-\\n\\n―36. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice by holding that fairness and transparency in public administration requires that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in the Annual Confidential Report of a public servant, whether in civil, judicial, police or any other State service (except the military), must be communicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a representation for its upgradation. This in our opinion is the correct legal position even though there may be no Rule/G.O. requiring communication of the entry, or even if there is a Rule/G.O. prohibiting it, because the principle of non- arbitrariness in State action as envisaged by Article 14 of the Constitution such in our opinion communication. Article 14 will override all rules or government orders.‖\\n\\nrequires\\n\\n9. Mr. Saini lastly submits that there is no question of compliance of\\n\\npre-condition and pre-requisite of Section 11(1) read with Section 19(4) of\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 5 of 10\\n\\nthe RTI Act.\\n\\n10. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this Court finds that in\\n\\nthe case of Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Public Information Officer AIR\\n\\n2010 Delhi 216, a Coordinate Bench of this Court has held that service\\n\\nrecord of a Government employee contained in the DPC minutes/ACR is\\n\\n“personal” to such officer and that such information can be provided to a\\n\\nthird party only after giving a finding as regards the larger pubic interest\\n\\ninvolved. It was also held in the said judgement that thereafter third party\\n\\nprocedure mentioned in Section 11(1) of the RTI Act would have to be\\n\\nfollowed. The relevant portion of the judgment in Arvind Kejriwal is\\n\\nreproduced hereinbelow:-\\n\\n―21. This Court has considered the above submissions. It requires to be noticed that under the RTI Act information that is totally exempt from disclosure has been listed out in Section 8. The concept of privacy is incorporated in Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. This provision would be a defense available to a person about whom information is being sought. Such defence could be taken by a third party in a proceeding under Section 11(1) when upon being issued notice such third party might want to resist disclosure on the grounds of privacy. This is a valuable right of a third party that encapsulates the principle of natural justice inasmuch as the statute mandates that there cannot be a disclosure of information pertaining to or which „relates to‟ such third party without affording such third party an opportunity of being heard on whether such disclosure should be ordered. This is a procedural safeguard that has been inserted in the RTI Act to balance the rights of privacy and the public interest involved in disclosure of such information. Whether one should trump the other is ultimately for the information officer to decide in the facts of a given case.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 6 of 10\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\nxxx\\n\\n25. The logic of the Section 11(1) RTI Act is plain. Once the information seeker is provided information relating to a third party, it is no longer in the private domain. Such information seeker can then disclose in turn such information to the whole world. There may be an officer who may not want the whole world to know why he or she was overlooked for promotion. The defence of privacy in such a case cannot be lightly brushed aside saying that since the officer is a public servant he or she cannot possibly fight shy of such disclosure. There may be yet another situation where the officer may have no qualms about such disclosure. And there may be a third category where the credentials of the officer appointed may be thought of as being in public interest to be disclosed. The importance of the post held may also be a factor that might weigh with the information officer. This exercise of weighing interests can possibly be undertaken only after hearing all interested parties. Therefore the procedure under Section 11(1) RTI Act.‖ the competing\\n\\n11. This Court is also of the opinion that the finding of public interest\\n\\nwarranting disclosure of the said information under Sections 8(1)(e) and\\n\\n8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and the procedure contemplated under Sections 11(1)\\n\\nand 19(4) of the RTI Act are mandatory in nature and cannot be waived. In\\n\\nthe present case, CIC has directed the petitioner to provide DPC minutes to\\n\\nthe respondent without considering the defence of the petitioner under\\n\\nSection 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act and without following the procedure\\n\\nspecified under Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act. It is pertinent to\\n\\nmention that Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act incorporate the\\n\\nprinciples of natural justice. Further, in the present case no finding has been\\n\\ngiven by CIC as to whether public interest warranted such a disclosure.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 7 of 10\\n\\n12. However, this Court is of the view that the respondent is entitled to\\n\\nthe contents of his own ACR after redaction of the names of the reviewing,\\n\\nreporting and accepting officers. In fact, another coordinate Bench of this\\n\\nCourt in THDC India Ltd. v. T. Chandra Biswas 199(2013) DLT 284 has\\n\\nheld as under:-\\n\\n―9. While the learned counsel for the respondent has contended before me that the respondent ought to have been supplied with the ACRs for the period 2004 to 2007, the respondent has not assailed that part of the order of the CIC. In my view, while the contention of the respondent has merit, which is that she cannot be denied information with regard to her own ACRs and that information cannot fall in the realm of any of the exclusionary provisions cited before me by the learned counsel for the petitioner i.e. Section 8(1)(d), (e) and (j), there is a procedural impediment, in as much as, there is no petition filed to assail that part of the order passed by the CIC.\\n\\n9.1. In my view, the right to obtain her own ACRs inheres in the respondent which cannot be denied to the respondent under the provisions of Section 8(1)(d), (e) and (j) of the RTI Act. The ACRs are meant to inform an employee as to the manner in which he has performed in the given period and the areas which require his attention, so that he may improve his performance qua his work.\\n\\n9.2 That every entry in the ACR of an employee requires to be disclosed whether or not an executive instruction is issued in that behalf – is based on the premise that disclosure of the contents of ACR results in fairness in action and transparency in public administration. See Dev Dutt vs Union of India (2008) 8 SCC 725 at page 732, paragraph 13; page 733, paragraph 17; and at page 737, paragraphs 36, 37 and 38.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 8 of 10\\n\\n9.3 Mr Malhotra sought to argue that, in Dev Dutt’s case, the emphasis was in providing information with regard to gradings and not the narrative. Thus a submission cannot be accepted for more than one reason.\\n\\n9.4 First, providing to an employee gradings without the narrative is like giving a conclusion in judicial/quasi- judicial or even an administrative order without providing the reasons which led to the conclusion. If the purpose of providing ACRs is to enable the employee to assess his performance and to judge for himself whether the person writing his ACR has made an objective assessment of his work, the access to the narrative which led to the grading is a must. [See State of U.P. Vs. Yamuna Shankar Misra and Anr., (1997) 4 SCC 7]. The narrative would fashion the decision of the employee as to whether he ought to challenge the grading set out in the ACR.\\n\\n9.5 Second, the fact that provision of ACRs is a necessary concomitant of a fair and efficient transparent, administration is now recognized by the DOPT in its OM dated 14.05.2009. The fact that the OM is prospective would not, in my view, impinge upon the underlying principle the OM seeks to establish. The only caveat one would have to enter, is that, while providing the contents of the ACR the names of the Reviewing, Reporting and the Accepting Officer will have to be redacted.‖\\n\\n13. Consequently, this Court is of the view that ACR grading/ratings as\\n\\nalso the marks given to\\n\\nthe candidates based on the said ACR\\n\\ngrading/ratings and their interview marks contained in the DPC proceedings\\n\\ncan be disclosed only to the concerned employee and not to any other\\n\\nemployee as that would constitute third party information. This Court is\\n\\nalso of the opinion that third party information can only be disclosed if a\\n\\nW.P.(C) 903/2013\\n\\nPage 9 of 10\\n\\nfinding of a larger public interest being involved is given by CIC and further\\n\\nif third party procedure as prescribed under Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the\\n\\nRTI Act is followed.\\n\\n14. Accordingly, the present writ petition is allowed and the matter is\\n\\nremanded back to CIC for consideration of petitioner‟s defences under\\n\\nSections 8(1)(e) and Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and if the CIC is of the\\n\\nview that larger public interest is involved, it shall thereafter follow the third\\n\\nparty procedure as prescribed under Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI\\n\\nAct.\\n\\n15.

The application stands disposed of.\\n\\nW.P.(C) 5478/2014\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe present petition has been filed by the petitioner impugning an\\n\\norder dated 13.06.2014 passed by the Central Information Commissioner\\n\\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘CIC’), whereby the appeal preferred by the\\n\\npetitioner against an order dated 03.04.2013 passed by the First Appellate\\n\\nAuthority had been rejected. The order dated 03.04.2013 had in turn\\n\\nrejected the petitioner’s appeal against an order dated 11.02.2013 passed by\\n\\nrespondent bank’s Central Public Information Officer (hereinafter referred\\n\\nas ‘CPIO’). By the said order, the CPIO of respondent bank refused to\\n\\nW.P.(C) No. 5478/2014\\n\\nPage 1 of 5\\n\\nprovide the information sought by the petitioner in respect of its customer\\n\\ninter alia on the ground that the same was held by the bank in a fiduciary\\n\\ncapacity and was exempted under Section 8 of the Right to Information\\n\\nAct, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the \\'RTI Act\\').\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBriefly stated, the facts are that on 18.01.2013, the petitioner applied\\n\\nunder the RTI Act to the CPIO of the respondent bank seeking the\\n\\nfollowing information with respect to Manraj Charitable Trust - a society\\n\\nregistered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860:-\\n\\n“a) Entire record pertaining to opening of the Bank Account by\\n\\nMCT including the a/c opening form.\\n\\nb)\\n\\nAll subsequent documents, resolutions, authority submitted with the Bank.\\n\\nletters,\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThe actual date of submission/receipt of letter dated 14/8/99 in and by the bank.”\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThereafter, the petitioner sent another application on 22.01.2013\\n\\nseeking further information. By its order dated 11.02.2013, the CPIO of the\\n\\nrespondent bank declined to provide the said information on the ground that\\n\\ninformation pertaining to its customers was exempt from the provisions of\\n\\nthe RTI Act by virtue of clauses (d), (e) and (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI\\n\\nAct. Aggrieved by the denial of the said information, the petitioner\\n\\npreferred an appeal before the First Appellate Authority, which was also\\n\\ndismissed by an order dated 03.04.2013. The decision of the First Appellate\\n\\nAuthority was carried in appeal before the CIC.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nBy the impugned order, the CIC accepted the submissions of the\\n\\nrespondent bank that the information in respect of its customers was\\n\\nW.P.(C) No. 5478/2014\\n\\nPage 2 of 5\\n\\nexempt form the RTI Act as the same was held by the bank in a fiduciary\\n\\ncapacity and, accordingly, rejected the appeal of the petitioner.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner\\n\\nwas the secretary of Manraj Charitable Trust and as an office bearer was\\n\\nentitled to information relating to the said Trust. It was further submitted\\n\\nthat Manraj Charitable Trust was a charitable institution and, therefore,\\n\\nlarger public interest would warrant disclosure of information by the\\n\\nrespondent bank. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the\\n\\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission v.\\n\\nSaiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi: (2012) 13 SCC 61 to contend that even\\n\\ninformation held in fiduciary capacity can be disclosed by a Competent\\n\\nAuthority if a larger public interest so warrants.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nThe respondent bank claimed that as per its records, the petitioner\\n\\nwas neither reflected as a Secretary of the Trust nor was authorised to\\n\\noperate the bank accounts. It was further stated that there were disputes\\n\\npending between the petitioner and her relatives. And, the information\\n\\nsought by the petitioner was not for any larger public interest but,\\n\\napparently, to assist her in the litigation pending between the petitioner and\\n\\nher family members.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe controversy raised in the present petition is whether a bank is\\n\\nobliged to disclose information pertaining to its customers in response to an\\n\\napplication made under the RTI Act.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe Bank, while dealing with its customers, acts in various\\n\\ncapacities. Undisputedly, the relationship between a customer and a banker\\n\\nrequires trust, good faith, honesty and confidence. Black’s law dictionary\\n\\nW.P.(C) No. 5478/2014\\n\\nPage 3 of 5\\n\\ndefines fiduciary relationship as “one founded on trust or confidence\\n\\nreposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.” Fiduciary\\n\\nrelationship in law is ordinarily a confidential relationship; one which is\\n\\nfounded on the trust and confidence. In this view, a banker would\\n\\nundoubtedly, stand in a fiduciary capacity in respect of transactions and\\n\\ninformation provided by its customers.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed\\n\\nHussain Abbas Rizwi: (2012) 13 SCC 61 examined the term “fiduciary\\n\\nrelationship” in context of Section 8 of the RTI Act and held as under:-\\n\\n“The term “fiduciary relationship” is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person places complete confidence in another person in regard to his affairs, business or transactions. This aspect has been discussed in some detail in the judgment of this Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education. Section 8(1)(e), therefore, carves out a protection in favour of a person who possesses information in his fiduciary relationship. This protection can be negated by the competent authority where larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information, in which case, the authority is expected to record reasons for its satisfaction. Another very significant provision of the Act is 8(1)(j). In terms of this provision, information which relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual would fall within the exempted category, unless the authority concerned is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. It is, therefore, to be understood clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as a rule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be permitted, that too, for reasons to be recorded demonstrating satisfaction to the test of larger public interest.”\\n\\nW.P.(C) No. 5478/2014\\n\\nPage 4 of 5\\n\\n10. The records of the bank do not indicate the petitioner to be a\\n\\nsecretary of the said Trust or its authorized officer. Thus, the bank has\\n\\ntreated the petitioner as a stranger, and in my view, rightly so. The\\n\\nrespondent bank is thus not obliged to provide any information to the\\n\\npetitioner in respect of the account of the said trust.\\n\\n11. Admittedly, the petitioner has certain pending disputes with regard to\\n\\nthe affairs of Manraj Charitable Trust and a suit (being CS(OS)\\n\\nNo.3203/2012) is stated to have been filed by the petitioner in this Court in\\n\\nher capacity as Secretary of the Trust in question. In this view, the\\n\\nsubmission of the petitioner that the respondent bank is liable to disclose\\n\\nthe information sought in larger public interest, also cannot be accepted.\\n\\n12. The present petition is, accordingly, without merit and is dismissed.\\n\\nVIBHU BAKHRU, J\\n\\nAUGUST 27, 2014 MK\\n\\nW.P.(C) No. 5478/2014\\n\\nPage 5 of 5\\n\\n\\n\\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\n+\\n\\nLPA 34/2015 & C.M.No.1287/2015\\n\\nReserved on: 09.04.2015 Pronounced on: 17.04.2015\\n\\nSUBHASH CHANDRA AGARWAL\\n\\n.....

The appeal preferred by the appellant herein was dismissed by the\\n\\nFirst Appellate Authority by order dated 07.03.2011. However, the\\n\\nfurther appeal to the CIC was allowed and by order dated 03.08.2011, the\\n\\nCIC directed the CPIO to provide the total amount of medical expenses of\\n\\nindividual judges reimbursed by the Supreme Court during the last three\\n\\nyears both in India and abroad wherever applicable. There was also a\\n\\ndirection that the CPIO shall bring to the notice of the competent\\n\\nauthority in the Supreme Court and ensure that arrangements are made in\\n\\nfuture for maintaining the information as expected in Section 4(1)(a) of\\n\\nthe RTI Act. In pursuance thereof, by letter dated 30.08.2011, the CPIO\\n\\nwhile furnishing the actual total expenditure for the years 2007-08, 2008-\\n\\n09 and 2009-10, informed the appellant herein that the judge-wise\\n\\ninformation regarding actual total medical expenditure is not required to\\n\\nbe maintained and is not maintained. Contending that the information\\n\\nfurnished by CPIO is not in compliance with the order dated 03.08.2011,\\n\\nthe appellant herein had again approached the CIC and thereupon by\\n\\norder dated 01.02.2012 the CIC reiterated its directions dated 03.08.2011.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nAggrieved by the said order, the appellant herein filed W.P.(C)\\n\\nNo.1842/2012. By the order under appeal, the learned Single Judge\\n\\nallowed the writ petition holding that the order passed by CIC\\n\\nLPA No.34/2015 Page 2 of 6\\n\\npurportedly in exercise of power under Section 19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act is\\n\\nerroneous. While taking note of the fact that the information sought by\\n\\nthe respondent/appellant herein was with regard to expenses incurred on\\n\\nmedical facilities of judges retired as well as serving and that the said\\n\\ninformation is personal information which is exempted from disclosure\\n\\nunder Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and that the medical bills would\\n\\nindicate the treatment and/or medicines required by individuals and the\\n\\nsame would clearly be an invasion of the privacy, the learned Single\\n\\nJudge held that the question of issuing any directions under Section\\n\\n19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act to facilitate access to such information does not\\n\\narise.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nAssailing the said order, Sh.Prashant Bhushan the learned Counsel\\n\\nappearing for the appellant vehemently contended that the information\\n\\npertaining to expenditure of public money on a public servant is not\\n\\nexempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. It is submitted by the\\n\\nlearned counsel that only the information which relates to personal\\n\\ninformation which has no relation to any public activity or interest or\\n\\nwhich would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual is\\n\\nexempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) and that the same is not\\n\\nattracted to the case on hand since the medical bills of the judges are\\n\\nreimbursed from the public money. Placing reliance upon the decisions\\n\\nin State of UP Vs. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 SC 865, S.P.Gupta Vs.\\n\\nPresident of India & Ors., AIR 1982 SC 149 and Union of India Vs.\\n\\nAssociation for Democratic Reforms, AIR 2002 SC 2112 it is further\\n\\ncontended by the learned counsel that the object and purpose of the RTI\\n\\nAct being promoting transparency and accountability in spending the\\n\\nLPA No.34/2015 Page 3 of 6\\n\\npublic money to strengthen the core constitutional values of a democratic\\n\\nrepublic,\\n\\nthe\\n\\ninformation sought by\\n\\nthe appellant\\n\\nrelating\\n\\nto\\n\\nreimbursement of medical bills of the individual judges, under no\\n\\ncircumstances, can be termed as exempted information under Section\\n\\n8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is submitted by Sh.Siddharth Luthra, the\\n\\nlearned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondents No.1 & 2 that the\\n\\ninformation sought by the appellant would cause unwarranted invasion of\\n\\nprivacy of the individual judges and, therefore, the learned Single Jude\\n\\nhas rightly held that Section 8(1)(j) is attracted. To substantiate his\\n\\nsubmission, the learned Senior Counsel relied upon Central Board of\\n\\nSecondary Education & Anr. Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. 2011\\n\\n(8) SCC 497 and Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs. Central\\n\\nInformation Commissioner & Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 212.\\n\\n7. We have given our\\n\\nthoughtful consideration\\n\\nto\\n\\nthe rival\\n\\nsubmissions made by the parties. It is no doubt true that the RTI Act,\\n\\n2005 is aimed at providing access to the citizens to information under the\\n\\ncontrol of public authorities in order to promote transparency and\\n\\naccountability in the working of the every public authority. However, as\\n\\nheld in the case of Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. (Supra) the RTI Act\\n\\ncontains certain safeguards by providing exemption from disclosure of\\n\\ncertain information including the information which would cause\\n\\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual except where the\\n\\nlarger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nIn the case on hand, the CPIO by his letter dated 30.08.2011 has\\n\\nadmittedly furnished the amount that has been reimbursed on medical\\n\\nLPA No.34/2015 Page 4 of 6\\n\\ntreatment from the budget grant of each year for the period from 2007 to\\n\\n2010 making it clear that during the said period no reimbursement for\\n\\nmedical treatment abroad was made. It was also specifically mentioned\\n\\nby the CPIO that the judge-wise information was not maintained as the\\n\\nsame was not required to be maintained.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIt is no doubt true that Section 19(8)(a)(iv) empowers the appellate\\n\\nauthority to require the public authority to make necessary changes to its\\n\\npractices in relation to the maintenance, management and destruction of\\n\\nrecord for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the\\n\\nRTI Act. However, as rightly held by the learned Single Judge the said\\n\\npower cannot be invoked to direct creation of information but the same\\n\\ncan be only with regard to the existing information.\\n\\n10. The information sought by the appellant includes the details of the\\n\\nmedical facilities availed by the individual judges. The same being\\n\\npersonal information, we are of the view that providing such information\\n\\nwould undoubtedly amount to invasion of the privacy. We have also\\n\\ntaken note of the fact that it was conceded before the learned Single\\n\\nJudge by the learned counsel for the appellant herein that no larger public\\n\\ninterest is involved in seeking the details of the medical facilities availed\\n\\nby the individual judges. It may also be mentioned that the total\\n\\nexpenditure incurred for the medical treatment of the judges for the\\n\\nperiod in question was already furnished by the CPIO by his letter dated\\n\\n30.08.2011 and it is not the case of the appellant that the said expenditure\\n\\nis excessive or exorbitant. That being so, we are unable to understand\\n\\nhow the public interest requires disclosure of the details of the medical\\n\\nfacilities availed by the individual judges. In the absence of any such\\n\\nLPA No.34/2015 Page 5 of 6\\n\\nlarger public interest, no direction whatsoever can be issued under\\n\\nSection 19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act by the appellate authorities. Therefore on\\n\\nthat ground also the order passed by the CIC dated 01.02.2012 is\\n\\nunsustainable and the same has rightly been set aside by the learned\\n\\nSingle Judge.\\n\\n11. For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is devoid of any merits and\\n\\nthe same is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE\\n\\nDEEPA SHARMA, J\\n\\nAPRIL 17, 2015 ‘anb’\\n\\nLPA No.34/2015 Page 6 of 6\\n\\n5/22/2018 IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\nW.P.(C) 6086/2013\\n\\nUNION PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION .....

JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU\\n\\nO R D E R\\n\\n21.11.2014\\n\\n1. The petitioner impugns an order dated 18.06.2013 passed by the Central Information Commission (hereinafter referred to as ?CIC?) whereby the petitioner was directed to disclose certain information relating to other candidates who were subject to the selection process undertaken by the petitioner.\\n\\n2. The question to be adressed is whether the petitioner was obliged to disclose information relating to other candidates i.e. the third party information under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ?Act?).\\n\\n3. The brief facts of the present case are that the respondent was working as a Senior Administrative Officer (Legal) in the office of Controller and Auditor General of India (hereafter ?CAG?) and had appeared before the Departmental Promotion Committee (hereinafter ?DPC?) for the selection to the post of Deputy Director (Legal) in the office of CAG. The respondent had filed an application dated 05.11.2012 under the Act inter alia seeking certain information relating to the said selection process which included the Bio Data as well as other information relating to other candidates. 4. While most of the information was supplied by the petitioner, the\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\n1/3\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\ninformation relating to other candidates and certain other information was declined by the petitoner. This led the respondent to file an appeal before the first appellate authority, which was rejected by an order dated 07.01.2013. Aggrieved by the same, the respondent preferred an appeal before CIC. The CIC considered the appeal and directed the petitioner to supply the following information:-\\n\\n?i. The biodata of the candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation;\\n\\nii. the marks awarded to both the selected candidates as well as to the Appellant during the selection process;\\n\\niii the copy of the pro forma and comparative statement of eligibility placed before the Selection Committee, if any:\\n\\niv. a statement showing the period for which the ACRs/APARs of various candidates had been considered by the Selection Committee including the grading of the selected candidates as well as that of the Appellant and\\n\\nv. The copy of the reserve list prepared by the Selection Committee provided the selected candidate has already joined her duty.?\\n\\n5. Aggrieved by the direction of CIC to provide the Bio Data of the candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation, the petitioner has preferred this petition.\\n\\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the information sought by the respondent is a third party information and thus cannot be disclosed except in public interest and after following the due procedure under Section 11 and Section 19(4) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. The learned counsel referred to a decision of the Supreme Court in Union Public Service Commission v. Gouhari Kamila: Civil Appeal No. 6362/2013, decided on 06.08.2013 whereby the Supreme Court following its earlier decision rendered in CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay: (2011) 8 SCC 497 held as under:- ?12. By applying the ratio of the aforesaid judgment, we hold that the CIC committed a serious illegality by directing the Commission to disclose the information sought by the Respondent, at point Nos. 4 and 5 and the High Court committed an error by approving his order.\\n\\n13. We may add that neither the CIC nor the High Court came to the conclusion that disclosure of the information relating to other candidates was necessary in larger public interest. Therefore, the present case is not covered by the exception carved out in Section?8(1)(e)?of the Act.? 7. In view of the above, the submission of the learned counsel for the\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\n2/3\\n\\n5/22/2018\\n\\ndelhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\npetitioner that the present case is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in Gouhari Kamila (supra) is well founded. Clearly, the Bio Data of the other selected candidates is a third party information and is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(e) and under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n8. The impugned order does not indicate that disclosure of this information was vital in larger public interest. Further, it does not appear that the CIC had issued any notice under Section 19(4) of the RTI Act to other candidates before directing the disclosure of the information.\\n\\n9. Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the impugned order, in so far as it relates to disclosure of ?Bio Data of candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation? is concerned, is set aside. No order as to costs.\\n\\nVIBHU BAKHRU, J\\n\\nNOVEMBER 21, 2014/j\\n\\n$ 51\\n\\nhttp://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014\\n\\n3/3\\n\\n\\n\\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\\n\\n%\\n\\nDate of Decision: 08.11.2013\\n\\n+ W.P.(C) 5812/2010\\n\\nUPSC\\n\\n.....

In the aforesaid case, the respondent before the Apex Court had sought inter alia the following information:\\n\\nsimilar\\n\\ncame\\n\\nup\\n\\n“4. How many years of experience in the (Analytical methods and relevant research in the field of Ballistics) mentioned in the advertisement have been considered for the short listing of the candidates for the interview held for the date on 16.3.2010?\\n\\nfield\\n\\n5.

The appeal filed by the UPSC also came to be dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court. Being still aggrieved, the petitioner filed the aforesaid appeal by way of Special Leave. Allowing the appeal filed by the UPSC, the Apex Court inter alia held as under, relying upon its earlier decision in Bihar School Examination Board Vs. Suresh Prasad Sinha (2009) 8 SCC 483:\\n\\nBeing aggrieved from the Commission,\\n\\n“One of the duties of the fiduciary is to make thorough disclosure of all the relevant facts of all transactions between them to the beneficiary, in a fiduciary relationship. By that logic, the examining body, if it is in a fiduciary relationship with an examinee, will be liable to make a full disclosure of the evaluated answer books to the examinee and at the same time, owe a duty to the examinee not to disclose the answer books to anyone else. If A entrusts a document or an article to B to be processed, on completion of processing, B is not expected to give the document or article to anyone else but is bound to give the same to A who entrusted\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.5812/2010\\n\\nPage 5 of 7\\n\\nthe document or article to B for processing. Therefore, if a relationship of fiduciary and beneficiary is assumed between the examining body and the examinee with reference to the answer book, Section 8(1)(e)would operate as an exemption to prevent access to any third party and will not operate as a bar for the very person who wrote the answer book, seeking inspection or disclosure of it.”\\n\\nthe Commission committed a serious illegality by directing the UPSC to disclose the information at points 4 & 5 and the High Court also committed an error by approving the said order. It was noted that neither the CIC nor the High Court recorded a finding that disclosure of the aforesaid information relating to other candidates was necessary to larger public interest and, therefore, the case was not covered by the exception carved out in Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act.\\n\\nThe Apex Court held\\n\\nthat\\n\\nIn the case before this Court no finding 6. has been recorded by the Commission that it was in the larger public interest to disclose the information with respect to the qualification and experience of other shortlisted candidates. In the absence of recording such a finding the Commission directed disclosure of the aforesaid information to the respondent.”\\n\\ncould\\n\\nnot\\n\\nhave\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIn the present case, the information such as date of birth,\\n\\ninstitution and year of passing graduation, field experience and caste is\\n\\nW.P.(C) No.5812/2010\\n\\nPage 6 of 7\\n\\npersonal information of the selected candidates. There is no finding by\\n\\nthe Commission that it was in larger public interest to disclose the\\n\\naforesaid personal information of the recommended candidates. Even in\\n\\nhis application seeking information, the respondent did not claim that\\n\\nany larger public interest was involved in disclosing the aforesaid\\n\\ninformation. In the absence of such a claim in the application and a\\n\\nfinding to this effect by the Commission, no direction for disclosure of\\n\\nthe aforesaid personal information could have been given.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nFor the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order dated\\n\\n07.06.2010 passed by the Central Information Commission is hereby set\\n\\naside.\\n\\nThe writ petition stands disposed of.

By\\n\\nthe impugned order, the CIC has allowed respondent‘s appeal and has\\n\\ndirected MCD to disclose the information sought by him. The MCD claims\\n\\nthat the information which it is called upon to disclose is exempt from such\\n\\ndisclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005\\n\\n(hereafter ‗the Act‘).\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBriefly stated, the relevant facts necessary to address the controversy\\n\\nin this petition are as under:-\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 1 of 8\\n\\n2.1 On 18.02.2009, respondent filed an application under the Act seeking\\n\\ninformation relating to one Dr Ashok Rawat (one of the employees of\\n\\nMCD). The contents of the said application indicating the information\\n\\nsought by respondent are set out below:-\\n\\n―Kindly provide the Assets and Liabilities of D.H.O. Shahdara North Zone Mr Ashok Rawat Ji.\\n\\n1. Monthly salary\\n\\n2. Details of his children with age; how many are school fee and other going; expenditure; name of school\\n\\n3. Whether any transportation is availed of by the children; if yes, give details\\n\\n4. Whether he is in possession of his own house or in Govt. Accommodation; if it is on private rent the details of the rent agreement be supplied.\\n\\n5. Whether he has any immovable property in his name, his wife‘s name or in the name of his children.‘\\n\\n6. Whether any immovable property was purchased after entering into service in MCD in Delhi.\\n\\n7. Details of property which was disclosed by him at the time of joining.\\n\\n8. Details of anything more than Rs.10,000/- which was purchased by him during his service, with date when the the appropriate disclosure was made department and the same was duly assessed in his assessment of the financial year. to\\n\\n9. Whether the Government vehicle was being utilised for personal use or not.‖\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nInitially, by a letter dated 17.03.2009, the Public Information officer\\n\\n(PIO) of MCD declined to provide any information, inter alia, stating that\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 2 of 8\\n\\nthe information as sought by respondent was not ‗information‘ as defined\\n\\nunder Section 2(f) of the Act.\\n\\n2.3 The respondent‘s application was transferred to the concerned PIO\\n\\nby a letter dated 25.05.2009. Thereafter, the concerned PIO of MCD sent a\\n\\nletter dated 18.06.2009 declining to provide information sought at serial\\n\\nnos.5, 6 and 7 in the RTI application, for the following reasons:-\\n\\n―The information sought for by the applicant through this point, being secret documents/information which cannot be disclosed in the absence of a general or special order, under provisions of GIO (S.O.114) under sub-rule (1) of Rule 18 of CCS (Conduct) rules. 964 Clause 110 of the ―Manual of Office Procedure‖, Rule 11 of CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964 as the information sought for herein covers under section 8(j) of the RTI Act, 2005.‖\\n\\n2.4 Aggrieved by the same, respondent preferred an appeal before the\\n\\nFirst Appellate Authority (hereafter ‗the FAA‘) impugning the action of the\\n\\nPIO in denying the information sought. The FAA partially allowed the\\n\\nappeal by an order dated 20.05.2009 directing disclosure of information\\n\\nsought at serial nos.2 and 3 in the RTI application.\\n\\n2.5 Aggrieved by the non-disclosure of the complete information as\\n\\nsought, respondent preferred a second appeal under Section 19(3) of the\\n\\nAct.\\n\\n2.6 The said appeal was allowed by the impugned order and the CIC has\\n\\ndirected disclosure of all information pertaining to queries at serial nos.1\\n\\nand 4 to 9. The CIC rejected MCD‘s contention that the information as\\n\\nsought for by respondent was exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j)\\n\\nof the Act. The CIC was of the view that disclosure of information\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 3 of 8\\n\\npertaining to assets of public servants which is collected by a public\\n\\nauthority cannot be construed as invasion of the privacy of an individual.\\n\\n3. Ms Biji Rajesh, learned counsel for the MCD contended that\\n\\ninformation regarding the personal assets of its employees is required to be\\n\\ntreated as confidential and merely because employees of MCD are required\\n\\nto disclose their assets to MCD, the same would not exclude such\\n\\ninformation from the scope of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. She referred to\\n\\nthe decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Allahabad Bank v.\\n\\nNitesh Kumar Tripathi: 2013 SCC OnLine Del 2491 in support of her\\n\\ncontention. She also referred to the decisions of the Supreme Court in\\n\\nGirish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commission\\n\\n&Ors.: 2013 (1) SCC 212 and R. K. Jain v. Union of India & Anr.: (2013)\\n\\n14 SCC 794.\\n\\n4. Mr V K Sharma, the learned counsel for the respondent stated that he\\n\\nwas no longer pressing for disclosure of the information as initially sought\\n\\nby the respondent and had limited his request to information sought at\\n\\nserial nos.5, 6 and 7 in his RTI application. The said information being (a)\\n\\nwhether Dr Ashok Rawat held any immovable property in his name; (b)\\n\\nwhether any immovable property was purchased by him after entering\\n\\nservice with MCD in India including Delhi; and (c) the details of his\\n\\nproperties at the time of joining of service with MCD. Mr Sharma further\\n\\nstated that although at serial no.5, respondent had sought information as to\\n\\nthe immovable property in the name of Dr Ashok Rawat\\'s wife and children\\n\\nas well; he was no longer seeking that information.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIn view of the above, the only question required to be addressed is\\n\\nwhether MCD is obliged to disclose details of the immovable properties\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 4 of 8\\n\\nheld by its employees or whether such information is exempt from\\n\\ndisclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nBefore proceeding further, it would be relevant to refer to Section 8\\n\\n(1)(j) of the Act which reads as under:-\\n\\n―8. Exemption from disclosure of information. —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,—\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\nxxxx\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.‖\\n\\n7.\\n\\nIt is apparent from a plain reading of Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the\\n\\nAct that personal information which has no relationship to any public\\n\\nactivity or interest would be exempt from disclosure. However, such\\n\\ninformation can be disclosed provided that the PIO or the Appellate\\n\\nAuthority under the Act is satisfied that larger public interest justifies such\\n\\ndisclosure. In the present case there is no reason to believe that disclosure\\n\\nof information sought by respondent is for some larger public interest.\\n\\nRespondent has not provided any credible justification for seeking\\n\\ninformation regarding the personal assets of the MCD employee in\\n\\nquestion. Although, it has been contended that disclosure of assets of public\\n\\nservants and their families would serve to stem corruption, however, in the\\n\\npresent case, no particular facts have been disclosed by respondent which\\n\\nwill indicate that the information sought would serve a larger public\\n\\npurpose. In view of the above, the only question that needs to be answered\\n\\nis whether the information sought by respondent qualifies to be ―personal\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 5 of 8\\n\\ninformation‖, the disclosure of which has no relationship with any public\\n\\nactivity or interest.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nIn Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra), the Supreme Court had\\n\\nexamined the question whether the CIC was correct in denying information\\n\\npertaining to service career, details of assets and liabilities and movable and\\n\\nimmovable properties of the respondent therein (who was employed as an\\n\\nenforcement officer) on the ground that the information sought, fell within\\n\\nthe scope of ‗personal information‘. Answering the aforementioned\\n\\nquestion in the affirmative, the Supreme Court held that the said details\\n\\nsought for, which were denied by the CIC, qualified to be personal\\n\\ninformation as defined in Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act.\\n\\n9.\\n\\nIn Secretary General, Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra\\n\\nAgarwal: AIR 2010 Del 159, a full Bench of this Court observed that the\\n\\nobjective of freedom of information and objective of protecting personal\\n\\nprivacy would often conflict when an applicant seeks access to personal\\n\\ninformation of a third party. The Court held that the Act had recognized the\\n\\naforesaid conflict and had exempted personal information from disclosure\\n\\nunder Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. However, such bar preventing disclosure\\n\\nof personal information could be lifted if sufficient public interest was\\n\\nshown. The relevant extract of the said decision is reproduced below:-\\n\\n―114. There is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom of information and the objective of protecting personal privacy. These objectives will often conflict when an applicant seeks access for personal information about a third party. The conflict poses two related challenges for law makers; first, to determine where the balance should be struck between these aims; and, secondly, to determine the mechanisms for dealing with requests for such information. The conflict between the right to personal privacy and the public interest in the disclosure of personal information was recognized by the legislature by\\n\\nW.P.(C) 13219/2009\\n\\nPage 6 of 8\\n\\nexempting purely personal information under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. Section 8(1)(j) says that disclosure may be refused if the request pertains to ―personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual.‖ Thus, personal information including tax returns, medical records etc. cannot be disclosed in view of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. If, however, the applicant can show sufficient public interest in disclosure, the bar (preventing disclosure) is lifted and after duly notifying the third party ( i.e. the individual concerned with the information or whose records are sought) and after considering his views, the authority can disclose it. The nature of restriction on the right of privacy, however, as pointed out by the learned single Judge, is of a different order; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded to be greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at stake. This is so because a public servant is expected to act for the public good in the discharge of his duties and is accountable for them.\\n\\n115. The Act makes no distinction between an ordinary individual and a public servant or public official. As pointed out by the learned single Judge ―----- an individual‘s or citizen‘s fundamental rights, which include right to privacy - are not subsumed or extinguished if he accepts or holds public office.‖ Section 8(1)(j) ensures that all information furnished to public authorities – including personal information [such as asset disclosures] are not given blanket access. When a member of the public requests personal information about a public servant, - such as asset declarations made by him – a distinction must be made between personal data inherent to the person and those that are not, and, therefore, affect his/her private life. To quote the words of the learned single Judge ―if public servants ---- are obliged to furnish asset declarations, the mere fact that they have to furnish such declaration would not mean that it is part of public activity, or ―interest‖. ----- That the public servant has to make disclosures is a part of the system‘s endeavour to appraise itself of potential asset acquisitions which may have to be explained properly. However, such acquisitions can be made legitimately; no law bars public servants from acquiring properties or investing their income. The obligation to disclose Page 7 of 8\\n\\n115. The Act makes no distinction between an ordinary individual and a public servant or public official.

However, such acquisitions can be made legitimately; no law bars public servants from acquiring properties or investing their income. The obligation to disclose Page 7 of 8\\n\\nthese investments and assets is to check the propensity to abuse a public office, for a private gain.‖ Such personal information regarding asset disclosures need not be made public, unless public interest considerations dictates it, under Section 8(1)(j). This safeguard is made in public interest in favour of all public officials and public servants.‖\\n\\n10. There can be no doubt that the information sought by respondent is\\n\\npersonal information concerning an employee of MCD. Such information\\n\\ncould be disclosed only if respondent could establish that disclosure of such\\n\\ninformation was justified by larger public interest. Even if the PIO was\\n\\nsatisfied that disclosure of such information was justified, the PIO was\\n\\nrequired to follow the procedure given under Section 11 of the Act; that is,\\n\\nthe PIO was required to give a notice to the concerned employee stating\\n\\nthat he intends to disclose the information and invite the employee to make\\n\\nsubmissions on the question whether such information ought to be\\n\\ndisclosed.\\n\\n11.\\n\\nIn view of the above, the impugned order directing the disclosure of\\n\\npersonal information relating to the employee of MCD cannot be sustained.\\n\\nThe impugned order is, accordingly, set aside.\\n\\n12. MCD has already paid cost of ₹5000/- and this Court does not\\n\\nconsider it apposite to direct refund of the same.\\n\\n13.

JUSTICE V.K.JAIN\\n\\nJUDGMENT\\n\\nV.K.JAIN, J. (ORAL)\\n\\nIn WP(C) No.906/2012, the respondent before this Court filed an application\\n\\nseeking certain information, including details of the assets declared by all officers\\n\\nabove Scale-III of the petitioner bank. The said application was responded by the\\n\\nCPIO of the petitioner bank on 12th August, 2011. However, even before receipt of\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 1 of 7\\n\\nthe reply from the CPIO, the respondent had already preferred an appeal before the\\n\\nfirst Appellate Authority. Vide order dated 26th August, 2011, the First Appellate\\n\\nAuthority noticing that the appeal had been preferred even before disposal of the\\n\\napplication by CPIO, directed that a copy of the reply of the CPIO be sent to the\\n\\nappellant before him. In compliance of the said order, the petitioner bank provided\\n\\na copy of its earlier decision to the respondent vide its letter dated 5th September,\\n\\n2011. The respondent before this Court preferred a Second Appeal before the\\n\\nCentral Information Commission and also made a complaint to it under Section 18\\n\\nof the RTI Act. Vide impugned order dated 1st February, 2012, the Commission,\\n\\ninter alia, directed as under:-\\n\\n“….. Therefore we can state\\n\\nthat disclosure of\\n\\ninformation such as assets of a Public servant, which is\\n\\nroutinely collected by the Public authority and routinely\\n\\nprovided by the Public servants, - cannot be construed as\\n\\nan invasion on the privacy of an individual. There will\\n\\nonly be a few exceptions to this rule which might relate\\n\\nto information which is obtained by a Public authority\\n\\nwhile using extraordinary powers such as in the case of\\n\\na raid or phone-tapping. Any other exceptions would\\n\\nhave to be specifically justified. Besides the Supreme\\n\\nCourt has clearly ruled that even people who aspire to be\\n\\npublic servants by getting elected have to declare their\\n\\nproperty details. If people who aspire to be public\\n\\nservants must declare their property details it is only\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 2 of 7\\n\\nlogical that the details of assets of those who are public\\n\\nservants must be considered to be diclosable. Hence the\\n\\nexemption under Section 8(i)(j) cannot be applied in the\\n\\ninstant case.”\\n\\nBeing aggrieved from the order passed by the Commission, the petitioner is\\n\\nbefore this Court by way of this petition.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nIn WP(C) No.1191/2012, the respondent before this Court preferred an\\n\\nappeal under Section 19 of the RTI Act before the First Appellate Authority\\n\\nalleging therein that no information had been supplied to him pursuant to his\\n\\napplication dated 18/19 May, 2011, though the statutory period of 30 days had\\n\\nalready expired. The First Appellate Authority, vide its letter dated 19th August,\\n\\n2011 informed the respondent that no such application had actually been received\\n\\nby their PIO. Thereupon, the respondent made a complaint dated 18th August,\\n\\n2011 to the Central Information Commission alleging therein that no information\\n\\nhad been provided to him pursuant to his application dated 18th May, 2011\\n\\naddressed to the CPIO of the petitioner bank. A copy of the said complaint was\\n\\nforwarded to the petitioner by the Under Secretary of the Commission for giving its\\n\\nexplanation in the matter. On receipt of the copy of the complaint of the\\n\\nrespondent, the CPIO of the petitioner responded by its communication dated 1st\\n\\nOctober, 2011. However, the information with respect to assets and liabilities of\\n\\nthe officers in Gramin Bank, Triveni, Gramin Bank, Head Office Orrai and\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 3 of 7\\n\\nAllahabad UP Gramin Bank, Head Office Banda was not supplied to the\\n\\nrespondent. The said complaint was disposed of by the Commission, vide its order\\n\\ndated 10th February, 2012. During the course of hearing of the complaint, the\\n\\nCommission noted the contention of the petitioner that it had supplied the required\\n\\ninformation except the information with respect to the assets and liabilities of the\\n\\nemployees and details of the TA Bills. The Commission, vide impugned order\\n\\ndated 10th February, 2012 directed the PIO of the petitioner bank to provide\\n\\ninformation as about assets to the complainant.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThus, the only question involved in these petitions is whether the\\n\\ninformation with respect to the assets and liabilities which an employee furnishes\\n\\nto his employer can be directed to be disclosed under RTI Act.\\n\\nSection 8(1) (j) of the Act reads as under:-\\n\\n“ (j) information which relates to personal information the\\n\\ndisclosure of which has no relationship to any public\\n\\nactivity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted\\n\\ninvasion of the privacy of the individual unless the\\n\\nCentral Public Information Officer or the State Public\\n\\nInformation Officer or the appellate authority, as the case\\n\\nmay be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies\\n\\nthe disclosure of such information: Provided that the\\n\\ninformation which cannot be denied to the Parliament or\\n\\na State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.”\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 4 of 7\\n\\nIt would, thus, be seen that an information which has no relationship to any\\n\\npublic activity or interest of the employee concerned or which would cause some\\n\\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual cannot be directed to be\\n\\ndisclosed unless the CPIO/PIO or the Appellate Authority is satisfied that larger\\n\\npublic interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe question whether information with respect to the assets and liabilities of\\n\\nan employee exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act or not came up for\\n\\nconsideration before the Apex Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs. Cen.\\n\\nInformation Commr. and Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 212. In the case before the\\n\\nSupreme Court, the Commission had denied details of the assets and liabilities,\\n\\nmovable and immovable property of an employee on the ground that the\\n\\ninformation sought qualified to be „personal information;, as defined in Clause (j)\\n\\nof Section 8 (1) of the Act. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Commission, the\\n\\nappellant before the Supreme Court, preferred a writ petition which came to be\\n\\ndismissed by the Single Judge. An appeal preferred by him was also dismissed by\\n\\na Division Bench of the High Court. Being aggrieved form the order passed by the\\n\\nDivision Bench, he approached the Apex Court by way of Special Leave.\\n\\nDismissing the Special Leave Petition, the Apex Court, inter alia, held as under:-\\n\\n“…14.The details disclosed by a person in his income tax\\n\\nreturns are \"personal information\" which stand exempted from\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 5 of 7\\n\\ndisclosure under Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act,\\n\\nunless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public\\n\\nInformation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or\\n\\nthe Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public\\n\\ninterest justifies the disclosure of such information.”\\n\\n5.\\n\\nIt would, thus, be seen that the information with respect to the assets and\\n\\nliabilities of an employee, which he discloses to his employer in compliance of the\\n\\nService Rules applicable to him qualifies as personal information within the\\n\\nmeaning of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act and such information cannot be directed to be\\n\\ndisclosed unless the CPIO/PIO/Appellate Authority is satisfied that larger public\\n\\ninterest justifies disclosure of such information. It goes without saying that such\\n\\nsatisfaction needs to be recorded in writing before an order directing disclosure of\\n\\nthe information can be passed. A perusal of the impugned orders would show that\\n\\nin neither of these cases, the Commission was satisfied that larger public interest\\n\\njustified disclosure of the information sought by the applicant/respondent. Without\\n\\nbeing satisfied that larger public interest justified disclosure of the information\\n\\nsought in this regard, the Commission could not have passed an order directing\\n\\ndisclosure of information of this nature. The orders passed by Central Information\\n\\nCommission are, therefore, liable to be set aside on this ground alone. The\\n\\nimpugned orders are accordingly set aside.\\n\\nThe writ petition stands disposed of. There shall be no orders as to costs.\\n\\nWP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12\\n\\nPage 6 of 7\\n\\n6.\\n\\nThe petitioner had deposited Rs.5000/- each which could be incurred by the\\n\\nrespondent. Since the respondent has not put in appearance despite service, there\\n\\nwill be no justification for paying the said amount to him.

Saxena and Mr. Manoj Kumar\\n\\nThe first hearing was held on 5th November, 2008, when considering the points raised by the appellant it was decided to adjourned the hearing to 14th November, 2008 at 2.00PM.\\n\\nOn 14th November, 2008 the following persons were present: Appellant: Gita Dewan Verma Respondent: Mr.Hansraj representing PIO Mr. S.K. Saxena and Mr. Manoj Kumar\\n\\nThe key issues identified in the appellants second appeal on page 3 are as follows:\\n\\n(a) Does the agreement between GNCTD and CDP Consultant come under S.8(1)(d) or could it have been given with the Work Order (based on / in continuation of the Agreement) for complete reply to my request no. 5a (‘Letter commissioning CDP to IL&FS Ecosmart Ltd.”) ?\\n\\n= The Commission asked the respondent to justify our Section 8(1)(d) would apply to the agreement between GNCTD & CDP Consultants. The respondent stated that agreements are matters where commercial information of the Consultant is shared. The Commission asked the respondent to give a note giving its arguments in support of using this exemption. The Commission did not see this exemption as very obvious as made out by the respondent. Besides the respondent has not given any reasoning as to how Section 8(1)(d) applies in this case.\\n\\n(b) Do CDP Consultant submissions for various stages of payment come under S.8(1)(d) or could copies/particulars have been given in reply to my request no.5b (‘Letter by which IL&FS submitted final CDP’) ?\\n\\n= The appellant seeks to know if there were covering letters attached to various submissions. The Commission is asked the PIO to supply the covering letters accompanied with any of the submissions. In case there are no covering letters with some of the submissions this will be stated categorically.\\n\\n(c) Does information about ‘State Level Steering Committee’ and its procedures (whereby notice for its meeting is channel of submission and its ‘endorsement’ in unconfirmed minutes is approval) come under S.4(1)(b) and should it have been given for complete reply to my request nos.5c, d&e (records of submission and approval of CDP)\\n\\n= The PIO has been asked to give the information to the appellant whether there is any written procedure for the State Level Steering Committee. If there is no such procedure the PIO will state this clearly.\\n\\n(d) Was GNCTD obliged to obtain under S.2(f) and supply on my requests nos.2 & 3 information “for each of” who were consulted or submitted EOI/myself rather than general remarks about all, as given.?\\n\\n= The PIO has been asked to send the letter to IL&FS asking if there was any written down criteria by which participants were selected or rejected for the work shop and provide the answer to the appellant.\\n\\n(e) Is supply of CDP on CD “subject to condition” of no publication (to me) same “without publication authorization” (to Centre for Civil Society, on website of which CDP is published and which has also distributed further copies on CD) and, if CDP copyright “is with the Government”, ought copy on CD to have been refused (to all) under Section 8(1)(d)?\\n\\n= The appellant’s query insisting that the PIO must give a reply authorising her to publish the CD given to her can not be considered as a request for information as defined under the Act. The appellant is actually seeking a decision from the PIO and the way she has worded it can not be construed as seeking information under the Act.\\n\\nThe PIO has been asked to send the answers to a,b,c& d to the appellant with a copy marked to the Commission by 30th November, 2008. The appellant may send the rejoinder to the Commission and to the Respondent by 10th December, 2008.

Zile Singh for getting a water connection no. 62261K sanctioned on 07/08/2000.\\n\\n: : : : :\\n\\n23/05/2008 24/06/2008 04/07/2008 25/07/2008 01/08/2008\\n\\nDetail of required information:-\\n\\nPlease provide certified copies of the documents submitted for getting the\\n\\nwater connection no 62261 k.\\n\\nThe PIO replied. The required information is as under:-\\n\\n1. It is third party case, under the provision of the Act a letter for NOC has been issued to Show. Zile Singh at B-497, Azad Pur vide copy enclosed as Annexure “A”.\\n\\n2. In response to the same, the owner Mrs. Archana Sharma has requested “not to give or allow any details through certified copies, uncertified copies of personnel inspection about the property B-497, who purchased the property from Sh. Zile Singh Ex. R.C.copy enclosed as Annexure “B”\\n\\n3. This issue with the approval of Wx. Eng. (NW)-IV/Jt. Director (R) CNNW office.\\n\\nThe First Appellate Authority ordered:\\n\\n“The appellant in his RTI application has sought certified copies of documents submitted in respect of water connection No. 62261K. This water connection stands at B-497, Azadpur Village, Delhi in the name of Sh. Ziley Singh and was sanctioned on 05/08/2000. on receipt of RTI application a matter was addressed to Sh. Ziley Singh, B-497, Azadpur Village, Delhi seeking his permission to give details of water connection sanctioned in his name to Sh. Mahesh Kumar Sharma, the appellant. In response to this a reply dated 31/05/2008 has been received from Mrs. Archana Sharma and Sh. Rakesh Kumar Sharma stating that they did not want to disclose any information regarding above property to anyone including Mr. Mahesh Kumar Sharma. A second letter was received from Mrs. Archana Sharma w/o Rakesh Kumar Sharma that she is the rightful owner of property No. B-497, Mandirwali Gali, Village Azadpur, Delhi. and in support of that she has submitted a Sale Deed made by Sh. Ziley Singh in favour of Smt. Archana Sharma, wherein the said property B-497 Azadpur Village has been sold to her.\\n\\nThe RTI Act, should be kept away from domestic squabbles and should not be used to settle personal scores in the guise of seeking disclosure of information pertaining to third party i.e. in this case the brother of the appellant. This is a case of water connection of property B-497 Azadpur Village, Delhi in the name of Sh. Ziley Singh. Sh. Ziley Singh according to the appellant has expired. However, the current owner Smt. Archana Sharma has not get the water connection mutated in her name. in view of the death of Sh. Ziley Singh brought to the notice of the appellate Authority in the RTI hearing. Mrs. Archana Sharma who claims to be the rightful owner of this property is required to submit documents to get the water connection mutated in her name. The ZRO concerned is required to thoroughly check the documents and ensure that transfer of ownership of the property is verified before the ensure that transfer of ownership of the property is verified before the mutation is allowed.”\\n\\nRelevant Facts emerging during Hearing on 2 January 2009: The following were present Appellant: Mr. Mahesh Kumar Respondent: Dr. Bipin Behari representing Santosh D. Vaidya PIO Third party: Mr. Rakesh Kumar Sharma on behalf of Archana Sharma\\n\\nThe PIO has denied information saying it is third party information and the ‘third party’ Archana Sharma has objected. The appellant has pointed out that the information he is seeking is with regard to a meter of his deceased father Shri Zile Singh. Besides the PIO has advanced no reasons under Section 8 (1) to deny the information. Mere refusal of a ‘third party’ without any exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) being applicable cannot be a ground for refusal.\\n\\nThe First appellate authority instead of restricting himself to deciding the matter on basis of the proviso of the RTI act has chosen to give gratuitous advice of how RTI should be used. The PIO has advanced no exemption under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act, hence the denial of information is without any basis in law. During oral arguments the PIO claims exemption under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act\\n\\nThe appellant represents that he is seeking documents of his deceased father’s\\n\\napplication, and therefore he has as much right to these documents as any one else. The third party seeks time to submit his written arguments as to why the information should not be given to the appellant.\\n\\nThe Commission agrees that the third party must be given a chance to give his arguments. The third party will send his written submissions to the appellant and the Commission before 21 January 2009. The final hearing will held on 2 February 2009 at 5.00pm\\n\\nRelevant facts emerging at Hearing on 2 February 2009: Present on 2 February 2009 Appellant: Mr. Mahesh Kumar Sharma Respondent: Mr. Paras Ram PIO Third Party: Mr. Gaurav Kumar Mehta on behalf of Archana Sharma\\n\\nMr. Gaurav Kumar contends that he has the prerogative to decide whether to provide information as he is third party. He says that he feels that the order of the PIO and the First appellate authority is correct and his submissions made to the Commission on 21 January 2009 must be taken into account when deciding the matter. The information sought by the appellant has no relationship to Public interest. The credentials of the information-seeker must be ascertained. The respondent contends that the information is provided by the consumer in a fiduciary relationship and hence cannot be given.\\n\\nThe appellant contends that the connection was of his father and he has equal right to get the information and that nobody can claim exclusive third party rights for this information. The aim of transparency needs to be achieved, which will be achieved if information is made available. There is no violation of privacy, nor are the documents in what could be called private. The decision is reserved.\\n\\nOrder pronounced on 27 February:\\n\\nThe Commission has recorded the oral contentions of the appellant and the third party. It is now addressing the issues presented by the third party in its written submissions.\\n\\nIn paragraph 14 of the written submissions by the third party it has been claimed that Parliament/State Legislature can be denied information relating to a ‘third party’. This claim has no basis and is a clear misinterpretation of the law. At paragraph 15 it further states that disclosing the information has no relationship to public activity or interest and that giving the information would result in unwarranted invasion of her privacy given under Article 21 of the Constitution.\\n\\nIn paragraph 16 and 17 of the written submissions the appellant has cited a judgment of the Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat in the Special Civil Application nos. 16073 & 17067 of 2007 decided on 16/8/2007 (2008(2) RTI 461).\\n\\nThe appellant quotes from the judgment, “……looking to the provision of Section 11(1) of the Act, 2005, the words, the information ‘relating to or is supplied by the third party’ are such that it is for the third party to point out to the Public Information Officer sought for, to be disclosed supplied is treated as confidential but, third party can make a submission that now it is treating the said information as confidential. More so, when information is ‘relating to third party’ it may not be even know to that third party when and what information relating to third party, was collected by public body…….............. What is confidential to the third party is known to the third party alone. There may not be a rubber stamp upon the information that this is confidential information. It is right vested in the third party to treat any information ‘relating to or supplied by the third party’ as confidential.”\\n\\nThe said judgment also says, “What satisfaction must be arrived at, prior to disclosure of information about satisfaction must be arrived at, prior to the Act especially Section 8(d), 8(j) and proviso to Section 11(1) and looking to the process of disclosing information to the appellant ‘relating to or supplied by the third party and treated as confidential by the third party’, the Act imposes a duty upon Public Information Officer to arrive at a conclusion that public interest in disclosure outweighs, harm or injury, to the protected interest of such third party, or larger public interest warrants, disclosure of such information, in considering whether the\\n\\npublic interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interest of such third party, the Public Information Officer will have to consider the following: (i) The objections raised by the third party by claiming confidentiality in respect of the information sought for. (ii) Whether the information is being sought by the applicant in larger public interest or to wreak vendetta against the third party. In deciding that the profile of person seeking information and his credentials will have to be looked into. If the profile of the person seeking information, in light of other attending circumstances, leads to the construction that under the pretext of serving public interest, such person is aiming to settle personal score against the third party, it cannot be said that public interest warrants disclosure of the information solicited. (iii) The Public Information Officer, while dealing with the information relating to or supplied by the third party, has to constantly bear in mind that the Act does not become a tool in hands of a busy body to settle a personal score.” To summarize the contentions of the third party for not disclosing the information:\\n\\n1. The information has been given in a fiduciary relationship. 2. Disclosing it would be an intrusion on his privacy. 3. Third party has the right to refuse to divulge with information relating to him and unless a large Public interest can be established, the information will not be disclosed. The third party has also sought to justify his claim for denial of information by taking support from the judgment of Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat, which has been quoted above. The main points which appear to arise out of the said judgment are: a) It is necessary that a larger Public interest must be justified and the purpose of\\n\\nthe applicant and his profile and credentials looked at.\\n\\nb) The Public information officer is charged with the duty to ensure that the\\n\\nRight does not become a tool in the hands of a busy body.\\n\\nBefore we look at these objections and claim of exemption it will be worthwhile to look at some of the provisions of the RTI act relevant to this case: The preamble which is defines the purpose and essence of the Act: ‘WHEREAS the Constitution of India has established democratic Republic;\\n\\nAND WHEREAS democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Goverments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed;\\n\\nAND WHEREAS revelation of information in actual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information;\\n\\nAND WHEREAS it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interests while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic ideal;\\n\\nNOW, THEREFORE, it is expedient to provide for furnishing certain information to citizens who desire to have it’. Section 3 of the Act defines the purpose of the Act very succinctly: ‘Subject to the provisions of this Act, all citizens shall have the right to information.’ With a great economy of words this section is perhaps the most important section of the RTI Act 2005. The Sovereign Citizen of India has the right to access all\\n\\ninformation since he owns it, and this right may be curtailed only by the limited provisions of this Act. Section 4 imposes a duty on all Public Authorities to declare most information Suo moto: ‘4.\\n\\n(1) Every public authority shall\\n\\n(a) maintain all its records duly catalogued and indexed in a manner and form which facilitates the right to information under this Act and ensure that all records that are appropriate to be computerised are, within a reasonable time and subject to availability of resources, computerised and connected through a network all over the country on different systems so that access to such records is facilitated;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\npublish within one hundred and twenty days from the enactment of this Act,- (i)\\n\\nthe particulars of its organisation, functions and duties;\\n\\n(ii) the powers and duties of its officers and employees;\\n\\n(iii) the procedure followed in the decision making process,\\n\\nincluding channels of supervision and accountability;\\n\\n(iv) the norms set by it for the discharge of its\\n\\nfunctions;\\n\\n(v)\\n\\ninstructions, manuals and the rules, regulations, records, held by it or under its control or used by its employees for discharging its functions;\\n\\n(vi) a statement of the categories of documents that are held\\n\\n(vii)\\n\\nby it or under its control; the particulars of any arrangement that exists for consultation with, or representation by, the members of the public in relation to the formulation of its policy or implementation thereof;\\n\\n(viii) a statement of the boards, councils, committees and other bodies consisting of two or more persons constituted as its part or for the purpose of its advise, and as to whether meetings of those boards, councils, committees and other bodies are open to the public, or the minutes of such meetings are accessible for public; a directory of its officers and employees;\\n\\n(ix)\\n\\n(x)\\n\\n(xi)\\n\\nthe monthly remuneration received by each of its the system of officers and employees, compensation as provided in its regulations; the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on disbursements made;\\n\\nincluding\\n\\n(xii) including the amounts allocated beneficiaries of such programmes; (xiii) particulars of recipients of concessions, permits or\\n\\nthe manner of execution of subsidy programmes, of\\n\\nand\\n\\nthe\\n\\ndetails\\n\\nauthorisations granted by it;\\n\\n(xiv) details in respect of the information, available to or\\n\\n(xv)\\n\\nheld by it, reduced in an electronic form; the particulars of facilities available to citizens for obtaining information, including the working hours of a library or reading room, if maintained for public use;\\n\\n(xvi) the names, designations and other particulars of the\\n\\nPublic Information Officers; ,\\n\\n(xvii) such other information as may be prescribed;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n(d)\\n\\nand thereafter update these publications every year; publish all relevant facts while formulating important policies or announcing the decisions which affect public; provide reasons for its administrative or quasi judicial decisions to affected persons;\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nIt shall be a constant endeavour of every public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) of sub-section (1) to provide as much information suo moto to the public at regular including through various means of communications, intervals internet, so that the public have minimum resort to the use of this Act to obtain information. For the purposes of sub-section (1), every information shall be disseminated widely and in such form and manner which is easily accessible to the public. All materials shall be disseminated taking into consideration the cost. effectiveness, local language and the most effective method of communication in that local area and the information should be easily accessible, to the extent possible in electronic format with the Central Public Information Officer, or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, available free or at such cost of the medium or the print cost price as may be prescribed.\\n\\nExplanation: For the purposes of sub-sections (3) and (4), \"disseminated\" means making known or communicated the information to the public through notice boards, newspapers, public announcements, media broadcasts, the internet or any other means, including inspection of offices of any public authority.’\\n\\nIt will be important to note that in Subsection 1 (b) (xii) & (xiii) the Act mandates that Public authorities will Suo Moto declare details of beneficiaries of subsidy programs as well as particulars of recipients of concessions, permits or authorisations granted by it.\\n\\nSection 6 (2) states, ‘An applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him.’ Section 8 (1) specifies the information which is exempted. The relevant provisions in this case are ‘Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,-\\n\\n(e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information; and\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be,\\n\\nis satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:’\\n\\nParliament has clarified the exemptions of Section 8 (1) with the proviso,\\n\\n‘Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.’\\n\\nWith this sentence Parliament has recognized that the individual Citizen,- the sovereign of this democracy,- gives it legitimacy, and therefore its right to get information cannot exceed the right of its master.\\n\\nIn Section 8 (2) it states, ‘Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-section (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if public interests in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.’\\n\\nEven if the exemptions of Section 8 (1) apply in a particular matter, if there is larger public interest, information shall be disclosed. It is useful to comment here that an applicant does not have to show any public interest for disclosure of any information, unless a specific exemption under Section 8 (1) is established.\\n\\nAfter twenty years have elapsed, Parliament has whittled down the ten exemptions of the provisions of Section 8 (1) to just three with the proviso 8 (3), ‘ Subject clauses (a), (c) and (i) of sub-section (1), any information relating to any occurrence, event or matter which has taken place, occurred or happened twenty years before the date on which any request is made under section 6 shall be provided to any person making a request under that section:’\\n\\nto\\n\\nSection 11 of the RTI act, which is the basis on which the information is sought to denied to the appellant in the present case lays down: ‘11. (1)\\n\\nWhere a Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which. relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information:\\n\\nProvided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure out weighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party.\\n\\n(2) Where a notice is served by the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under sub-section (1) to a third party in respect of any information or record or part thereof, the third party shall, within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice, be given the opportunity to make representation against the proposed disclosure.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in section 7, the Central Public\\n\\nInformation Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under section 6, if the third party has been given an opportunity to make representation under sub-section (2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice of his decision to the third party.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nA notice given under sub-section (3) shall include a statement that the third party to whom the notice is given is entitled to prefer an appeal under section 19 against the decision.’\\n\\nThere are some peculiar matters in the present case. The information belongs to the late Mr. Zile Singh not to Ms. Archana Sharma who has objected. Besides the appellant claims to be the son of the late Mr. Zile Singh, which is contested by the third party. The Commission does not find it necessary to rule on these matters.\\n\\nThe Commission will first deal with the contentions of the third party: 1. The information has been given in a fiduciary relationship. The third party is invoking the protection of Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI act.\\n\\nA fiduciary relationship is one where the key element is that the relationship is principally characterized by trust and the information is given for use only for the benefit of the giver. Here the information has been given as per the rules to get an authorization to get a water connection, from the Public authority. The traditional definition of a fiduciary is a person who occupies a position of trust in relation to someone else, therefore requiring him to act for the latter\\'s benefit within the scope of that relationship. In business or law, we generally mean someone who has specific duties, such as those that attend a particular profession or role, e.g.,financial analyst or trustee. In the instant case a key element of the relationship between the applicant for a water connection and the Delhi Jal Board certainly cannot be said to be primarily of trust by the applicant in the Public authority, nor can it be said that the information was given for the benefit of the giver. The information was provided to get an authorization for a water connection.\\n\\n2. Disclosing it would be an intrusion on his privacy. The third party is invoking the protection of Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI act.\\n\\nUnder Section 8 (1) (j) information which has been exempted is defined as: \"information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\" To qualify for this exemption the information must satisfy the following criteria: 1. It must be personal information. Words in a law should normally be given the meanings given in common language. In common language we would ascribe the adjective \\'personal\\' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an Institution or a Corporate. From this it flows that \\'personal\\' cannot be related to Institutions, organisations or corporates. ( Hence we could state that Section 8 (1) (j) cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organisations or corporates.). The phrase \\'disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest\\' must be interpreted means that the information must have some relationship to a Public activity.\\n\\nVarious Public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for \\'personal\\' information from Citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. When a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a Public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorisation, all these are public activities.\\n\\nWe can also look at this from another aspect. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade on the privacy of a Citizen. In those circumstances special provisos of the law apply, always with certain safeguards. Therefore it can be argued that where the State routinely obtains information from Citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy. Certain human rights such as liberty, freedom of expression or right to life are universal and therefore would apply uniformly in all Countries uniformly. However, the concept of \\'privacy\\' is related to the society and different societies’ would look at these differently. India has not codified this right so far, hence in balancing the Right to Information of Citizens and the individual\\'s Right to Privacy the Citizen\\'s Right to Information would be given greater weightage. Therefore we can accept that disclosure of information which is routinely collected by the Public authority and routinely provided by individuals, would not be an invasion on the privacy of an individual and there will only be a few exceptions to this rule which might relate to information which is obtained by a Public authority while using extraordinary powers such as in the case of a raid or phone-tapping.\\n\\n3. Third party has the right to refuse to divulge with information relating to him, and unless a large Public interest can be established, the information will not be disclosed.\\n\\nNo legal provision has been cited.\\n\\nWe will now look at the main contentions relied upon by the third party from the judgement of the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court:\\n\\na) It is necessary that a larger Public interest must be justified and the purpose of the applicant and his profile and credentials looked at. b) The Public information officer is charged with the duty to ensure that\\n\\nthe Right does not become a tool in the hands of a busy body.\\n\\nThe Right to Information is a fundamental right of Citizens. The Act has elegantly and crisply defined its objective in Section 3 where it states ‘Subject to the provisions of this Act, all citizens shall have the right to information.’\\n\\nThe test of public interest is to be applied to give information, only if any of the exemptions of Section 8 apply. Even if the exemptions apply, the Act enjoins that if there is a larger Public interest, the information would still have to be given. There is no requirement in the Act of establishing any public interest for information to be obtained by the sovereign Citizen; nor is there any requirement to establish larger Public interest, unless an exemption is held to be valid. Insofar as looking at the credentials of the applicant are concerned, the lawmaker has categorically stated that\\n\\nin Section 6 (2) , ‘An applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him.’ Since the law categorically states that no information shall be required be supplied by the applicant except those that may be necessary for contacting him, it is clear that the credentials of the applicant are of no relevance, and are not to be taken into account at all when giving the information. Truth remains the Truth and it is not important who access it. If there is a\\n\\nlarger Public interest in disclosing a Truth, it is not relevant who gets it revealed. Hence we respectfully disagree with the contention of the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court.\\n\\nUnder this Act, providing information is the rule and denial an exception. Any attempt to constrict or deny information to the Sovereign Citizen of India without the explicit sanction of the law will be going against the rule of law. The Citizen needs to give no reasons nor are his credentials to be checked for giving the information. If the third party objects to giving the information, the Public Information Officer must take his objections and see if any of the exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) apply. If the any of the exemption clauses apply, the PIO is then obliged to see if there is a larger Public interest in disclosure. If none of the exemption clauses apply, information has to be given.\\n\\nThe third party’s objections made before the Commission about the exemptions of Section 8 (1) (e) & (j) are disallowed. Hence the information would have to be given.\\n\\nDecision : The Appeal is allowed. The PIO will give the information to the appellant before 15 March 2009.

R. Mazumder, PIO & Superintendent of Police on video conference from NIC- Kolkata Studio.\\n\\nBased on perusal of papers and the submissions of the Appellant, the Commission noted that information on queries (d), (f) and (g) appears to have been provided by the PIO, CBI (Kolkata). However, he has refused to provide information on queries (b), (c) and (e) on the basis of Sections 8(1)(g) and (h) of the RTI Act. The PIO, CBI (Port Blair) has refused to provide information on query (a) claiming Section 8(1)\\n\\n(g) of the RTI Act.\\n\\nThe Commission further noted that vide letter dated 16/11/2010, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has refused to provide information on queries (h) and (i) on the basis of Section 8(1)(g) and (j) of the RTI Act. The PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has relied on the decision of the Commission in P. Thavasiraj v. Dept. of Atomic Energy dated 02/09/2008. The Appellant has relied on the decisions of the Commission in CIC/WB/A/2007/01366 dated 31/10/2007, CIC/WB/A/2007/01370-71 and 1492 dated 06/11/2007- dated 04/03/2009.\\n\\nThe order was reserved during the hearing held on 23/05/2011.\\n\\nDecision announced on 13 July 2011:\\n\\nThe PIO, CBI (Kolkata) has refused to provide information on queries (b), (c) and (e) on the basis of inter alia Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act provides as follows:\\n\\n\"8. Exemption from disclosure of information.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,-\\n\\n...\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/\\n\\n3\\n\\nMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011\\n\\n(h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders;\"\\n\\nSection 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act exempts disclosure of information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Merely because the process of investigation or prosecution of offenders is continuing, the bar stipulated under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act is not attracted; it must be clearly established by the PIO that disclosure of the information would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Ravindra Bhat, J. of the High Court of Delhi in Bhagat Singh v. CIC W.P. (C) No. 3114/2007 has observed as follows:\\n\\n\"13. Access to information, under Section 3 of the Act, is the rule and exemptions under Section 8, the exception. Section 8 being a restriction on this fundamental right, must therefore is to be strictly construed. It should not be interpreted in manner as to shadow the very right itself. Under Section 8, exemption from releasing information is granted if it would impede the process of investigation or the prosecution of the offenders. It is apparent that the mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a ground for refusal of the information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory reasons as to why the release of such information would hamper the investigation process. Such reasons should be germane, and the opinion of the process being hampered should be reasonable and based on some material. Sans this consideration, Section 8(1)(h) and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demands for information.\\n\\n14. A rights based enactment is akin to a welfare measure, like the Act, should receive a liberal interpretation. The contextual background and history of the Act is such that the exemptions, outlined in Section 8, relieving the authorities from the obligation to provide information, constitute restrictions on the exercise of the rights provided by it. Therefore, such exemption provisions have to be construed in their terms; there is some authority supporting this view (See Nathi Devi v. Radha Devi Gupta 2005 (2) SCC 201; B. R. Kapoor v. State of Tamil Nadu 2001 (7) SCC 231 and V. Tulasamma v. Sesha Reddy 1977 (3) SCC 99). Adopting a different approach would result in narrowing the rights and approving a judicially mandated class of restriction on the rights under the Act, which is unwarranted.\" (Emphasis added) It is clear from the ruling of Ravindra Bhat, J. that the PIO, who is denying information under Section 8(1) (h) of the RTI Act, must show satisfactory reasons as to why disclosure of such information would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. These reasons must be relevant and the opinion of the PIO that by disclosing the information, prosecution of offenders shall be impeded should be reasonable. The opinion of the PIO must be based on some material and cannot be a mere apprehension not supported by any evidence. Parliament did not intend exempting information while a process of investigation or prosecution was ongoing.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/\\n\\n4\\n\\nMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011\\n\\nIt has stated that disclosure of information can be exempted only if it impedes the process of investigation or prosecution.\\n\\nIn the instant case, the PIO, CBI (Kolkata) has denied the information by simply quoting Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act and that such disclosure would impede the process of prosecution. However, he has failed to explain how such disclosure would actually be an impediment to the process of prosecution, as laid down above by the High Court of Delhi. The denial of information by the PIO appears to be a mere blanket statement not supported by any cogent evidence or material on the basis of which it can be clearly demonstrated that such disclosure would in fact attract the exemption contained in Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. In other words, the PIO has failed to discharge the burden placed upon him under Section 19(5) of the RTI Act to prove that the denial of information under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act was justified. On this basis, the Commission rejects the contention of the PIO that the information sought in queries (b),\\n\\n(c) and (e) was exempted under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act.\\n\\nFurther, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has denied the information sought in queries (h) and (i) on the basis of inter alia Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. Under Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act, information which has been exempted is defined as:\\n\\n\"information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: ...\"\\n\\nTo qualify for the exemption under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, the information must satisfy the following criteria:\\n\\n1. It must be personal information: Words in a law should normally be given the meaning given in common language. In common language, we would ascribe the adjective \\'personal\\' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an institution or a Corporate. Therefore, it flows that \\'personal\\' cannot be related to institutions, organisations or corporates. Hence Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organisations or corporates.\\n\\n2. The phrase \\'disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest\\' means that the information must have been given in the course of a public activity. Various public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for \\'personal\\' information from citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. Public activities would typically include situations wherein a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorisation, or provides information in discharge of a 5\\n\\n2. The phrase \\'disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest\\' means that the information must have been given in the course of a public activity. Various public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for \\'personal\\' information from citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. Public activities would typically include situations wherein a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorisation, or provides information in discharge of a 5\\n\\nMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011\\n\\nstatutory obligation.\\n\\n3. The disclosure of the information would lead to unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a citizen. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply usually with certain safeguards. Therefore where the State routinely obtains information from citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy.\\n\\nIn the instant case, the Appellant, in queries (h) and (i), has sought names of CBI officers who have been placed in the list of \\'doubtful integrity\\' during the period January 2006 till date and names of CBI officers against whom complaints are registered or contemplated and inquiry conducted or in progress. There is no doubt that the information sought is \"personal\" information as it pertains to individual CBI officers. Every public authority is required to have information including details of any complaints registered or contemplated or departmental enquiry initiated/ conducted against any of its officers as a matter of record and more so because such officers are public servants discharging public function. Any complaint registered and taken cognizance of, or inquiry conducted or in progress, by a public authority, is necessarily a public activity. Disclosure of such information cannot be construed as unwarranted invasion of privacy of the officer concerned, as it concerns issues raised in the exercise of his public activity as a public servant. Moreover, such officer is accountable to the public and therefore, every citizen has the right to obtain information that may affect such officer\\'s credibility and integrity.\\n\\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Supreme Court of India in Union of India v. ADR in Appeal (Civil) 178 of 2001 and W. P. (Civil) 294 of 2001 decided on 02/05/2002, observed that persons who aspire to be public servants by getting elected have to declare inter alia their property details, any conviction/ acquittal of criminal charges, etc. If persons who aspire to be public servants are required to declare such details, it is only logical that the details of any complaint registered or inquiry conducted or in progress against any officer must be considered to be disclosable. Therefore, the contention raised by the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) that the information sought under queries (h) and (i) was exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act is rejected.\\n\\nFurthermore, in relation to queries (a), (b), (c), (e), (h) and (i), information has also been denied on the basis of Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act. Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act exempts:\\n\\n\"information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes;\"\\n\\nIn query (b), the Appellant has sought a copy of the Visitor\\'s Register of SP, ACB- CBI (Kolkata) for a specific period. The purpose of a Visitor\\'s Register is to record the names of all persons entering the premises of an organisation. Typically, the very nature of a Visitor\\'s Register is such that details of persons who have already visited a premise and recorded in the register can be viewed by a\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/\\n\\n6\\n\\nMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011\\n\\nsubsequent visitor while filling in his details. The Appellant has not sought information regarding a specific visitor(s) and therefore, the Commission does not understand how the exemption under Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act is attracted in relation to query (b). As mentioned above, in queries (h) and (i), the Appellant has sought names of CBI officers who have been placed in the list of \\'doubtful integrity\\' during the period January 2006 till date and officers against whom complaints are registered or contemplated and inquiry conducted or in progress. The Appellant has sought only the names of such officers and no other details whatsoever. Therefore, if only names of such officers are disclosed, the Commission does not accept that it would endanger their life or physical safety. In other words, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has failed to establish before the Commission that the denial of information in queries (h) and (i) under Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act was justified.\\n\\nHowever, as regards queries (a), (c) and (e), the Commission is of the opinion that there is some merit in the contention raised by the PIOs and disclosure of the information sought may attract Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act, if it reveals names of persons who may have provided information or witnesses. Section 10(1) of the RTI Act provides as follows:\\n\\n\"10. Severability.- (1) Where a request for access to information is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to information which is exempt from disclosure, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, access may be provided to that part of the record which does not contain any information which is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains exempt information.\"\\n\\nUnder Section 10 of the RTI Act, it is possible to severe certain portions of the information before disclosing it to an applicant to ensure that information that is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act is not disclosed. Therefore, this Commission has decided to apply Section 10 of the RTI Act to the information sought by the Appellant on queries (a), (c) and (e). The PIO is directed to provide the complete information sought on queries (a), (c) and (e) after severing the names and other particulars of persons, the disclosure of which would endanger their life or physical safety or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes.\\n\\nThe Commission has perused the decisions cited before it and in view of the reasons given above, t h e d e c i s i o n s i n P .

She requested for the following information in the given formats for the period 12.10.05 to 31.3.06, 1.4.06 to 31.3.07 and 1.4.07 to 31.3.08\\n\\ni) RTI applications received, not responded, rejected, full information provided, part information provided, forwarded to another Public Authority\\n\\nii) Copies of the relevant pages of the application register or any other record of the applications received, their dates and the names and addresses of the applicants.\\n\\niii) To provide copies of all the RTI applications iv) No. of applications rejects within 30 days, within 31-60 days and after 60 days\\n\\nas well as complete information provided within 30 days, within 31-60 days and after 60 days\\n\\nv) Total applications rejected under each section of the RTI Act.\\n\\nvi) To provide copies of all first appeals vii) To provide copies of orders given by First Appellate Authority viii) No. of first appeals rejected within 30 days, within 31-45 days and after 45\\n\\ndays as well as no. of first appeals accepted partly or wholly within 30 days, within 31- 60 days and after 60 days.\\n\\nix) In how many first appeals the applicant has given an opportunity of being heard before the appeal was decided.\\n\\nThe PIO, ECoR, Waltair replied on 21.7.08 furnishing point wise information while denying information u/s 8(1)(j) against points 6 and 7 and stating that information was maintained in his division against points 8 and 9. The Applicant filed an appeal dt.6.10.08 with the Appellate Authority, South Central Railway, Secunderabad stating that with regard to points 3, 6 and 7 of her RTI application, the PIO has invoked section 8(1)(j) to deny her copies of RTI applications and first appeals. She stated that copies of RTI applications are required to contain only the names and\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1322091/\\n\\n1\\n\\nMs.Bincy Thomas vs East Coast Railway, Waltair on 12 January, 2010\\n\\naddresses of the applicant as Section 6(2) specifically forbids the asking of any personal details. She added that even for argument\\'s sake if some applications contain some material whose disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy, section 10 obligates the PIO to exclude those portions that are exempt u/s 8(1) (j) of the few applications that might be so affected and make available the rest of the applications and the non- exempt portions of these few applications.\\n\\nii) Regarding point 2, she stated that details of the names and addresses of Applicants who file an appeal with the Information Commission are put up on the CIC website and therefore, it cannot be considered to be personal information.\\n\\niii) Regarding points 4, 8 and 9, the Applicant stated that the PIO is obliged to transfer her application to the concerned PIO in no case later than 5 days from the date of receipt of the application.\\n\\nOn not receiving any reply from the First Appellate Authority, she filed a second appeal dt.16.1.09 before CIC.\\n\\n2. The Bench of Mrs. Annapurna Dixit, Information Commissioner, scheduled the hearing for January 12, 2010.\\n\\n3. Shri B.Somulu, PIO was heard through audio conferencing .\\n\\n4. The Appellant was not present during the hearing.\\n\\nDecision\\n\\n5. The Commission received a rejoinder dt.4.1.10 from the Appellate Authority, ECoR, Visakhapatnam stating that the RTI application dated 12.6.08 was transferred by the PIO East Coast Railway to all three Addl. DRMs and PIO Khurda Road, Vishakhapatnam and Sambalpur Divisions on 20.6.08. The Addnl. DRM and PIO Waltair Division furnished the information on 21.7.08. The AA further stated that the first appeal was addressed wrongly by the Appellant to South Central Railway, Secunderabad because of which there was inordinate delay in disposing off the appeal. He further added that the Appellate Authority, ECoR, Waltair replied on 26.5.09.\\n\\n6. The Commission also received a rejoinder dt.11.1.10 from the Appellant stating that the Addl. DRM in his letter dt.4.1.10 had stated that they are not to be blamed for the delay as the Appellant had addressed the first appeal to the wrong person. She added that despite there being a legal obligation u/s 7(3) (b) to give the details of the Appellate Authority, no such details were given in the response of the PIO and her first appeal was forwarded to the correct Appellate Authority vide letter dt.21.10.08 and the response reportedly dt.26.5.09, seems to have been received seven months after her first appeal was received by the correct Appellate Authority and over four months after she filed her second appeal. According to the Appellant, she did not receive the letter dt.26.5.09. In the letter of 26.5.09, a statement has been made that the asked for information cannot be provided because it is voluminous in nature despite the fact in the response given on 21.7.08 the PIO had stated that 2\\n\\nMs.Bincy Thomas vs East Coast Railway, Waltair on 12 January, 2010\\n\\nonly 135 applications had been received till 30.6.08 which as contended by the Appellant is not a \\'voluminous \\'number.\\n\\n6. The Commission on reviewing the submissions made by both sides, warns the PIO to refrain from taking lightly the Statutory provisions under Section 7(3) (b) of the RTI Act whereby he is obligated to provide details of the Appellate Authority to whom the appeal is to be addressed and warns him not to violate the law in such manner in future. As for information having been denied since its is voluminous, the Commission holds that Section 7(9) of the Act does not allow denial of information but denial of providing the same in the form in which it has been sought in the event this leads to disproportionate diversion of resources of the Public Authority. The Commission has also noted that certain information has been denied under Section 8(1) (j) of the RTI Act as information that is \\'personal\\'. The Public Authority is aware of the fact that the Commission itself is displaying on its website its Orders in the case of appeals to the Commission and that these orders contain details of information being sought by the Applicants and the responses of the Public Authority. Hence, the RTI applications are no longer \\'personal\\' in nature. In any event, the Public Authority can always invoke Section 10(1) of the RTI Act to sever any part of the document that is personal and is exempt from disclosure, while giving reasons for the decision as laid down in Section 10(2).\\n\\n7. The Commission on careful consideration of the submissions of both sides and keeping in mind the Respondent\\'s plea that providing the information in the format in which it has been sought will disproportionately divert the resources of the Public Authority, directs the PIO to provide the copies of RTI applications (using Section 10(1)( if required) to provide separate categories of photocopies of all the RTI applications for the period 12 October, 2005 to 31 March, 2008 , received by the Public Authority as follows: Not responded to (1st category); Rejected (2nd category) and responded to (3rd category), and transferred to another Public Authority (4th category). The Appellant may compile and analyze the data herself yearwise from these 3 categories of information as sought by her in points 1, 4, 5, 8. The photocopied information against points 2, 6, 7 also to be provided by the Public Authority to the Appellant including all the Orders in which the applications have been rejected besides information against point 9.\\n\\n8. The information to be provided free of cost and to reach the Appellant by 15.2.2010 and the Appellant to submit a compliance report to the Commission by 20.2.2010.\\n\\n9. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.\\n\\n(Annapurna Dixit) Information Commissioner Authenticated true copy:\\n\\n(G.Subramanian) Deputy Registrar Cc:\\n\\n1.

EQBAL, J.\\n\\nThe main issue that arises for our consideration in these transferred cases is as to whether all the information sought for under the Right to Information Act, 2005 can be denied by the Reserve Bank of India and other Banks to the public at large on the ground of economic interest, commercial confidence, fiduciary relationship with other Bank on the one hand and the public interest on the other. If the answer to above question is in negative, then upto what extent the information can be provided under the 2005 Act.\\n\\n2. It has been contended by the RBI that it carries out inspections of banks and financial institutions on regular basis and the inspection reports prepared by it contain a wide range of information that is collected in a fiduciary capacity. The facts in brief of the Transfer Case No.91 of 2015 are that during May-June, 2010 the statutory inspection of Makarpura Industrial Estate Cooperative Bank Ltd. was conducted by RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Thereafter, in October 2010, the Respondent sought following information from the CPIO of RBI under the Act of 2005, reply to which is tabulated hereunder: |Sr. No.|Information sought |Reply | |1. |Procedure Rules and |RBI is conducting inspections | | |Regulations of Inspection |under Section 35 of the B.R. | | |being carried out on |Act 1949 (AACS) at prescribed | | |Co-operative Banks |intervals. | |2. |Last RBI investigation and |The Information sought is | | |audit report carried out by|maintained by the bank in a | | |Shri Santosh Kumar during |fiduciary capacity and was | | |23rd April, 2010 to 6th |obtained by Reserve Bank | | |May, 2010 sent to Registrar|during the course of | | |of the Cooperative of the |inspection of the bank and | | |Gujarat State, Gandhinagar |hence cannot be given to the | | |on Makarpura Industrial |outsiders.

On 30.3.2011, the First Appellate Authority disposed of the appeal of the respondent agreeing with the reply given by CPIO in query No.2, 3 & first part of 4, relying on the decision of the Full Bench of CIC passed in the case of Ravin Ranchochodlal Patel and another vs. Reserve Bank of India. Thereafter, in the second appeal preferred by the aggrieved respondent, the Central Information Commission by the impugned order dated 01.11.2011, directed RBI to provide information as per records to the Respondent in relation to queries Nos.2 to 6 before 30.11.2011. Aggrieved by the decision of the Central Information Commission (CIC), petitioner RBI moved the Delhi High Court by way of a Writ Petition inter alia praying for quashing of the aforesaid order of the CIC. The High Court, while issuing notice, stayed the operation of the aforesaid order.\\n\\n4. Similarly, in Transfer Case No. 92 of 2015, the Respondent sought following information from the CPIO of RBI under the Act of 2005, reply to which is tabulated hereunder:\\n\\n|Sr. |Information sought |Reply | |No. | | | |1. |The Hon’ble FM made a |In the absence of the specific| | |written statement on the |details, we are not able to | | |Floor of the House which |provide any information. | | |inter alia must have been | | | |made after verifying the | | | |records from RBI and the | | | |Bank must have the copy of | | | |the facts as reported by | | | |FM.

In this matter, it has been alleged by the petitioner RBI that the respondent is aggrieved on account of his application form for three-in-one account with the Bank and ICICI Securities Limited (ISEC) lost in the floods in July, 2005 and because of non-submission of required documents, the Trading account with ISEC was suspended, for which respondent approached the District Consumer Forum, which rejected the respondent’s allegations of tempering of records and dismissed the complaint of the respondent. His appeal was also dismissed by the State Commission. Respondent 5\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nthen moved an application under the Act of 2005 pertaining to the suspension of operation of his said trading account. As the consumer complaint as well as the abovementioned application did not yield any result for the respondent, he made an application under the Act before the CPIO, SEBI, appeal to which went up to the CIC, the Division Bench of which disposed of his appeal upholding the decision of the CPIO and the Appellate Authority of SEBI. Thereafter, in August 2009, respondent once again made the present application under the Act seeking aforesaid information. Being aggrieved by the order of the appellate authority, respondent moved second appeal before the CIC, who by the impugned order directed the CPIO of RBI to furnish information pertaining to Advisory Notes as requested by the respondent within 15 working days. Hence, RBI approached Bombay High Court by way of writ petition.\\n\\n6. In Transfer Case No. 93 of 2015, the Respondent sought following information from the CPIO of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development under the Act of 2005, reply to which is tabulated hereunder:-\\n\\n|Sl. |Information Sought |Reply | |No. | | |\\n\\n|1. |Copies of inspection reports |Furnishing of information is | | |of Apex Co-operative Banks of|exempt under Section 8(1)(a) of| | |various States/Mumbai DCCB |the RTI Act. | | |from 2005 till date | | |2. |Copies of all correspondences|Different Departments in NABARD| | |with Maharashtra State |deal with various issues | | |Govt./RBI/any other agency of|related to MSCB.

The First Appellate Authority concurred with the CPIO and held that inspection report cannot be supplied in terms of Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act. The Respondent filed Second Appeal before the Central Information Commission, which was allowed. The RBI filed writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of the CIC dated 14.11.2011 on identical issue and the High Court stayed the operation of the order of the CIC.\\n\\n8.

The Central Information Commission heard the parties through video conferencing.

The CPIO, UBD has stated that the same is exempted under Section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act.

Various transfer petitions were, therefore, filed seeking transfer of the writ petitions pending before different High Courts. On 30.5.2015, while allowing the transfer petitions filed by Reserve Bank of India seeking transfer of various writ petitions filed by it in the High Courts of Delhi and Bombay, this Court passed the following orders:\\n\\n“Notice is served upon the substantial number of respondents. Learned counsel for the respondents have no objection if Writ Petition Nos. 8400 of 2011, 8605 of 2011, 8693 of 2011, 8583 of 2011, 32 of 2012, 685 of 2012, 263 of 2012 and 1976 of 2012 pending in the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi and Writ Petition (L) Nos. 2556 of 2011, 2798 of 2011 and 4897 of 2011 pending in the High Court of Bombay are transferred to this Court and be heard together. In the meanwhile, the steps may be taken to serve upon the unserved respondents.\\n\\nAccordingly, the transfer petitions are allowed and the above mentioned writ petitions are withdrawn to this Court. The High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Bombay are directed to remit the entire record of the said writ petitions to this Court within four weeks.”\\n\\n22. Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner-Reserve Bank of India, assailed the impugned orders passed by the Central Information Commissioner as illegal and without jurisdiction. Learned Counsel referred various provisions of The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 and made the following submissions:- The Reserve Bank of India being the statutory authority has been constituted under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 for the purpose of regulating and controlling the money supply in the country. It also acts as statutory banker with the Government of India and State Governments and manages their public debts. In addition, it regulates and supervises Commercial Banks and Cooperative Banks in the country.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n14\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nThe RBI exercises control over the volume of credit, the rate of interest chargeable on loan and advances and deposits in order to ensure the economic stability. The RBI is also vested with the powers to determine “Banking Policy” in the interest of banking system, monetary stability and sound economic growth.\\n\\nThe RBI in exercise of powers of powers conferred under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 conducts inspection of the banks in the country.\\n\\nThe RBI in its capacity as the regulator and supervisor of the banking system of the country access to various information collected and kept by the banks. The inspecting team and the officers carry out inspections of different banks and much of the information accessed by the inspecting officers of RBI would be confidential. Referring Section 28 of the Banking Regulation Act, it was submitted that the RBI in the public interest may publish the information obtained by it, in a consolidated form but not otherwise.\\n\\nThe role of RBI is to safeguard the economic and financial stability of the country and it has large contingent of expert advisors relating to matters deciding the economy of the entire country and nobody can doubt the bona fide of the bank. In this connection, learned counsel referred the decision of this Court in the case of Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and Another Vs. Reserve Bank of India, 1992 Vol. 2 SCC 343.\\n\\nReferring the decision in the case of B. Suryanarayana Vs. N. 1453 The Kolluru Parvathi Co-Op. Bank Ltd., 1986 AIR (AP) 244, learned counsel submitted that the Court will be highly chary to enter into and interfere with the decision of Reserve Bank of India. Learned Counsel also referred to the decision in the case of Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and Another Vs. Reserve Bank of India, 1992 Vol. 2 SCC 343 and contended that Courts are not to interfere with the economic policy which is a function of the experts.\\n\\nThat the RBI is vested with the responsibility of regulation and supervision of the banking system. As part of its supervisory role, RBI supervises and monitors the banks under its jurisdiction through on-site inspection conducted on annual basis under the statutory powers derived by it under section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, off-site returns on key financial parameters and engaging banks in dialogue through periodical meetings. RBI may take supervisory actions where warranted for violations of its guidelines/directives. The supervisory actions would depend on the seriousness of the offence, systemic implications and may range from imposition of penalty, to issue of strictures or letters of warning. While RBI recognizes and promotes enhanced transparency in banks disclosures to the public, as transparency strengthens market discipline, a bank may not be able to disclose all data that may be relevant to assess its risk profile, due to the inherent need to preserve confidentially in relation to its customers. In this light, while mandatory disclosures include certain\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n15\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nprudential parameters such as capital adequacy, level of Non Performing Assets etc., the supervisors themselves may not disclose all or some information obtained on-site or off-site. In some countries, wherever there are supervisory concerns, “prompt corrective action” programmes are normally put in place, which may or may not be publicly disclosed. Circumspection in disclosures by the supervisors arises from the potential market reaction that such disclosure might trigger, which may not be desirable. Thus, in any policy of transparency, there is a need to build processes which ensure that the benefits of supervisory disclosure are appropriately weighed against the risk to stakeholders, such as depositors.\\n\\nAs per the RBI policy, the reports of the annual financial inspection, scrutiny of all banks/ financial institutions are confidential document cannot be disclosed. As a matter of fact, the annual financial inspection/ scrutiny report reflect the supervisor’s critical assessment of banks and financial institutions and their functions. Disclosure of these scrutiny and information would create misunderstanding/ misinterpretation in the minds of the public. That apart, this may prove significantly counter productive. Learned counsel submitted that the disclosure of information sought for by the applicant would not serve the public interest as it will give adverse impact in public confidence on the bank. This has serious implication for financial stability which rests on public confidence. This will also adversely affect the economic interest of the State and would not serve the larger public interest.\\n\\n23. The specific stand of petitioner Reserve Bank of India is that the information sought for is exempted under Section 8(1)(a), (d) and (e) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. As the regulator and supervisor of the banking system, the RBI has discretion in the disclosure of such information in public interest.\\n\\n24. Mr. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel, referred various decisions to the High Court and submitted that the disclosure of information would prejudicially affect the economic interest of the State. Further, if the information sought for is sensitive from the point of adverse market reaction leading to systematic crisis for financial stability.\\n\\n25. Learned senior counsel put heavy reliance on the Full Bench decision of the Central Information Commissioner and submitted that while passing the impugned order, the Central Information Commissioner completely overlooked the Full Bench decision and ignored the same. According to the learned counsel, the Bench, which passed the impugned order, is bound to follow the Full Bench decision. The Commission also erred in holding that the Full Bench decision is per incuriam as the Full Bench has not considered the statutory provisions of Section 8 (2) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\n26. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the Commission erred in holding that even if the information sought for is exempted under Section 8(1) (a), (d) or (e) of the Right to Information Act, Section 8(2) of the RTI Act would mandate the disclosure of the information.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n16\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n27. Learned senior counsel further submitted that the basic question of law is whether the Right to Information Act, 2005 overrides various provisions of special statutes which confer confidentiality in the information obtained by the RBI.; If the Respondents are right in their contention, these statutory provisions of confidentiality in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 would be repealed or overruled by the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\n28. Under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India has a right to obtain information from the banks under Section 27. These information can only be in its discretion published in such consolidated form as RBI deems fit. Likewise under Section 34A production of documents of confidential nature cannot be compelled. Under sub-section (5) of Section 35, the Reserve Bank of India may carry out inspection of any bank but its report can only be disclosed if the Central Government orders the publishing of the report of the Reserve Bank of India when it appears necessary.\\n\\n29. Under Section 45E of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, disclosure of any information relating to credit information submitted by banking company is confidential and under Section 45E(3) notwithstanding anything contained in any law no court, tribunal or authority can compel the Reserve Bank of India to give information relating to credit information etc.\\n\\n30. Under Section 17(4) of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, credit information received by the credit information company cannot be disclosed to any person. Under Section 20, the credit information company has to adopt privacy principles and under Section 22 there cannot be unauthorized access to credit information.\\n\\n31. It was further contended that the Credit Information Companies Act, 2005 was brought into force after the Right to Information act, 2005 w.e.f. 14.12.2006. It is significant to note that Section 28 of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 was amended by the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. This is a clear indication that the Right to Information Act, 2005 cannot override credit information sought by any person in contradiction to the statutory provisions for confidentiality.\\n\\n32. This is in addition to other statutory provisions of privacy in Section 44 of State Bank of India Act, 1955, Section 52, State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, Section 13 of the Banking Companies (Acquisition & Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970.\\n\\n33. The Right to Information Act, 2005 is a general provision which cannot override specific provisions relating to confidentiality in earlier legislation in accordance with the principle that where there are general words in a later statute it cannot be held that the earlier statutes are repealed altered or discarded.\\n\\n34. Learned counsel submitted that Section 22 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 cannot have the effect of nullifying and repealing earlier statutes in relation to confidentiality. This has been well settled by this Court in\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n17\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\na) Raghunath vs. state of Karnataka 1992(1) SCC 335 at p.348 pages 112 and 114\\n\\nb) ICICI Bank vs. SIDCO Leather etc., 2006(10) SCC 452 at p. 466, paras 36 & 37\\n\\nc) Central Bank vs. Kerala, 2009 (4) SCC 94 at p. 132-133 para 104\\n\\nd) AG Varadharajalu vs. Tamil Nadu, 1998 (4) SCC 231 at p. 236 para 16.\\n\\nHence, the Right to Information Act, 2005 cannot override the provisions for confidentiality conferred on the RBI by the earlier statutes referred to above.\\n\\n35. The Preamble of the RTI Act, 2005 itself recognizes the fact that since the revealing of certain information is likely to conflict with other public interests like “the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information”, there is a need to harmonise these conflicting interests. It is submitted that certain exemptions were carved out in the RTI Act to harmonise these conflicting interests. This Court in Central Board of Secondary Education and Anr. vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay and Ors, (2011)8 SCC 497, has observed as under:- “When trying to ensure that the right to information does not conflict with several other public interests (which includes efficient operations of the Governments, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information, optimum use of limited fiscal resources, etc.), it is difficult to visualise and enumerate all types of information which require to be exempted from disclosure in public interest. The legislature has however made an attempt to do so. The enumeration of exemptions is more exhaustive than the enumeration of exemptions attempted in the earlier Act, that is, Section 8 of the Freedom to Information Act, 2002. The courts and Information Commissions enforcing the provisions of the RTI Act have to adopt a purposive construction, involving a reasonable and balanced approach which harmonises the two objects of the Act, while interpreting Section 8 and the other provisions of the Act.”\\n\\n36. Apart from the legal position that the Right to Information Act, 2005 does not override statutory provisions of confidentiality in other Act, it is submitted that in any case Section 8(1)(a) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 states that there is no obligation to give any information which pre-judiciously affects the economic interests of the States. Disclosure of such vital information relating to banking would pre- judiciously affect the economic interests of the State. This was clearly stated by the Full Bench of the Central Information Commission by its Order in the case of Ravin Ranchchodlal Patel (supra). Despite this emphatic ruling individual Commissioners of the Information have disregarded it by holding that the decision of the Full Bench was per incurium and directed disclosure of information.\\n\\n37. Other exceptions in Section 8, viz 8(1)(a)(d), 8(1)(e) would also apply to disclosure by the RBI and banks. In sum, learned senior counsel submitted that the RBI cannot be directed to disclose information relating to banking under the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n18\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n38. Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents in Transfer Case Nos.94 & 95 of 2015, began his arguments by referring the Preamble of the Constitution and submitted that through the Constitution it is the people who have created legislatures, executives and the judiciary to exercise such duties and functions as laid down in the constitution itself.\\n\\n39. The right to information regarding the functioning of public institutions is a fundamental right as enshrined in Article 19 of the Constitution of India. This Hon’ble Court has declared in a plethora of cases that the most important value for the functioning of a healthy and well informed democracy is transparency. Mr. Bhushan referred Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 SC 865, and submitted that it is a Government’s responsibility like ours, where all the agents of the public must be responsible for their conduct, there can be but few secrets. The people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their functionaries. The right to know, which is derived from the concept of freedom of speech, though not absolute, is a factor which should make one wary, when secrecy is claimed for transactions which can, at any rate, have no repercussion on public security. To cover with veil of secrecy, the common routine business is not in the interest of public.\\n\\n40. In the case of S.P. Gupta v. President of India and Ors., AIR 1982 SC 149, a seven Judge Bench of this Court made the following observations regarding the right to information:-\\n\\n“There is also in every democracy a certain amount of public suspicion and distrust of Government, varying of course from time to time according to its performance, which prompts people to insist upon maximum exposure of its functioning. It is axiomatic that every action of the Government must be actuated by public interest but even so we find cases, though not many, where Governmental action is taken not for public good but for personal gain or other extraneous considerations. Sometimes Governmental action is influenced by political and other motivations and pressures and at times, there are also instances of misuse or abuse of authority on the part of the executive. Now, if secrecy were to be observed in the functioning of Government and the processes of Government were to be kept hidden from public scrutiny, it would tend to promote and encourage oppression, corruption and misuse or abuse of authority, for it would all be shrouded in the veil of secrecy without any public accountability. But if there is an open Government with means of information available to the public, there would be greater exposure of the functioning of Government and it would help to assure the people a better and more efficient administration. There can be little doubt that exposure to public gaze and scrutiny is one of the surest means of achieving a clean and healthy administration. It has been truly said that an open Government is clean Government and a powerful safeguard against political and administrative aberration and inefficiency.”\\n\\n41. In the case of the Union of India vs. Association for Democratic Reforms, AIR 2002 SC 2112, while declaring that it is part of the fundamental right of citizens under Article 19(1)(a) to know the assets and liabilities of candidates contesting election to the Parliament or the State Legislatures, a three Judge Bench of this Court held unequivocally that:- “The right to get information in a\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n19\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\ndemocracy is recognized all throughout and is a natural right flowing from the concept of democracy (Para 56).” Thereafter, legislation was passed amending the Representation of People Act, 1951 that candidates need not provide such information. This Court in the case of PUCL vs. Union of India, (2003) 4 SCC 399, struck down that legislation by stating: “It should be properly understood that the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution such as, right to equality and freedoms have no fixed contents. From time to time, this Court has filled in the skeleton with soul and blood and made it vibrant. Since the last more than 50 years, this Court has interpreted Articles 14, 19 and 21 and given meaning and colour so that the nation can have a truly republic democratic society.”\\n\\n42. The RTI Act, 2005, as noted in its very preamble, does not create any new right but only provides machinery to effectuate the fundamental right to information. The institution of the CIC and the SICs are part of that machinery. The preamble also inter-alia states “… democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed.”\\n\\n43. The submission of the RBI that exceptions be carved out of the RTI Act regime in order to accommodate provisions of RBI Act and Banking Regulation Act is clearly misconceived. RTI Act, 2005 contains a clear provision (Section 22) by virtue of which it overrides all other Acts including Official Secrets Act. Thus, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law like RBI Act or Banking Regulation Act, the RTI Act, 2005 shall prevail insofar as transparency and access to information is concerned. Moreover, the RTI Act 2005, being a later law, specifically brought in to usher transparency and to transform the way official business is conducted, would have to override all earlier practices and laws in order to achieve its objective. The only exceptions to access to information are contained in RTI Act itself in Section 8.\\n\\n44. In T.C.No.94 of 2015, the RTI applicant Mr. P.P. Kapoor had asked about the details of the loans taken by the industrialists that have not been repaid, and he had asked about the names of the top defaulters who have not repaid their loans to public sector banks. The RBI resisted the disclosure of the information claiming exemption under Section 8(1) (a) and 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act on the ground that disclosure would affect the economic interest of the country, and that the information has been received by the RBI from the banks in fiduciary capacity. The CIC found these arguments made by RBI to be totally misconceived in facts and in law, and held that the disclosure would be in public interest.\\n\\n45. In T.C.No.95 of 2015, the RTI applicant therein Mr. Subhash Chandra Agrawal had asked about the details of the show cause notices and fines imposed by the RBI on various banks. The RBI resisted the disclosure of the information claiming exemption under Section 8(1)(a),(d) and 8(1) (e) of the RTI Act on the ground that disclosure would affect the economic interest of the country, the competitive position of the banks and that the information has been received by RBI in fiduciary capacity. The CIC, herein also, found these arguments made by RBI to be totally misconceived in facts and in law and held that the disclosure would be in public interest.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n20\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n46. In reply to the submission of the petitioner about fiduciary relationship, learned counsel submitted that the scope of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act has been decided by this Court in Central Board of Secondary Education vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay, (2011) 8 SCC 497, wherein, while rejecting the argument that CBSE acts in a fiduciary capacity to the students, it was held that:\\n\\n“…In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies can be said to act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to students who participate in an examination, as a Government does while governing its citizens or as the present generation does with reference to the future generation while preserving the environment. But the word ‘information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship’ are used in Section 8(1) (e) of the RTI Act in its normal and well recognized sense, that is to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the action of the fiduciary.”\\n\\n47. We have extensively heard all the counsels appearing for the petitioner Banks and respondents and examined the law and the facts.\\n\\n48. While introducing the Right to Information Bill, 2004 a serious debate and discussion took place. The then Prime Minister while addressing the House informed that the RTI Bill is to provide for setting out practical regime of right to information for people, to secure access to information under the control of public authorities in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority. The new legislation would radically alter the ethos and culture of secrecy through ready sharing of information by the State and its agencies with the people. An era of transparency and accountability in governance is on the anvil. Information, and more appropriately access to information would empower and enable people not only to make informed choices but also participate effectively in decision making processes. Tracing the origin of the idea of the then Prime Minister who had stated, “Modern societies are information societies. Citizens tend to get interested in all fields of life and demand information that is as comprehensive, accurate and fair as possible.” In the Bill, reference has also been made to the decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that Right to Information has been held as inherent in Article 19 of our Constitution, thereby, elevating it to a fundamental right of the citizen. The Bill, which sought to create an effective mechanism for easy exercise of this Right, was held to have been properly titled as “Right to Information Act”. The Bill further states that a citizen has to merely make a request to the concerned Public Information Officer specifying the particulars of the information sought by him. He is not required to give any reason for seeking information, or any other personal details except those necessary for contacting him. Further, the Bill states:- “The categories of information exempted from disclosure are a bare minimum and are contained in clause 8 of the Bill. Even these exemptions are not absolute and access can be allowed to them in public interest if disclosure of the information outweighs the harm to the public authorities. Such disclosure has been permitted even if it is in conflict with the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1923. Moreover, barring two categories that relate to information disclosure – which may affect\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n21\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nsovereignty and integrity of India etc., or information relating to Cabinet papers etc.-all other categories of exempted information would be disclosed after twenty years.\\n\\nThere is another aspect about which information is to be made public. We had a lengthy discussion and it is correctly provided in the amendment under clause 8 of the Bill. The following information shall be exempted from disclosure which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India; which has been expressly forbidden; which may result in a breach of privileges of Parliament or the Legislature; and also information pertaining to defence matters. They are listed in clause 8 (a) to (g). There are exceptions to this clause. Where it is considered necessary that the information will be divulged in the interest of the State, that will be done. There must be transparency in public life. There must be transparency in administration and people must have a right to know what has actually transpired in the secretariat of the State as well as the Union Ministry. A citizen will have a right because it will be safe to prevent corruption. Many things are done behind the curtain. Many shoddy deals take place in the secretariats of the Central and State Governments and the information will always be kept hidden. Such practice should not be allowed in a democratic country like ours. Ours is a republic. The citizenry should have a right to know what transpired in the secretariat. Even Cabinet papers, after a decision has been taken, must be divulged as per the provisions of this amendment. It cannot be hidden from the knowledge of others.”\\n\\n49. Addressing the House, it was pointed out by the then Prime Minister that in our country, Government expenditure both at the Central and at the level of the States and local bodies, account for nearly 33% of our Gross National Product. At the same time, the socio-economic imperatives require our Government to intervene extensively in economic and social affairs. Therefore, the efficiency and effectiveness of the government processes are critical variables, which will determine how our Government functions and to what extent it is able to discharge the responsibilities entrusted. It was pointed out that there are widespread complaints in our country about wastefulness of expenditure, about corruption, and matter which have relations with the functioning of the Government. Therefore, it was very important to explore new effective mechanism to ensure that the Government will purposefully and effectively discharge the responsibilities entrusted to it.\\n\\n50. Finally the Right to Information Act was passed by the Parliament called “The Right to Information Act, 2005”. The Preamble states:-\\n\\n“An Act to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority, the constitution of a Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\\n\\nWHEREAS the Constitution of India has established democratic Republic;\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n22\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nAND WHEREAS democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed;\\n\\nAND WHEREAS revelation of information in actual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information;\\n\\nAND WHEREAS it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interest while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic ideal;\\n\\nNOW, THEREFORE, it is expedient to provide for furnishing certain information to citizens who desire to have it.”\\n\\n51. Section 2 of the Act defines various authorities and the words. Section 2(j) defines right to information as under :-\\n\\n“2(j) “right to information” means the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to-\\n\\ninspection of work, documents, records;\\n\\ntaking notes, extracts, or certified copies of documents or records;\\n\\ntaking certified samples of material;\\n\\nobtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device;”\\n\\n52. Section 3 provides that all citizens shall have the right to information subject to the provisions of this Act. Section 4 makes it obligatory on all public authorities to maintain records in the manner provided therein. According to Section 6, a person who desires to obtain any information under the Act shall make a request in writing or through electronic means in English or Hindi in the official language of the area in which the application is being made to the competent authority specifying the particulars of information sought by him or her. Sub- section (ii) of Section 6 provides that the applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him. Section 7 lays down the procedure for disposal of the request so made by the person under Section 6 of the Act. Section 8, however, provides certain exemption from disclosure of information. For better appreciation Section 8 is quoted hereinbelow:- 23\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n“8. Exemption from disclosure of information.— (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,—\\n\\n(a) information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence;\\n\\n(b) information which has been expressly forbidden to be published by any court of law or tribunal or the disclosure of which may constitute contempt of court;\\n\\n(c) information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature;\\n\\n(d) information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\n(e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\n(f) information received in confidence from foreign government;\\n\\n(g) information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes;\\n\\n(h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders;\\n\\n(i) cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers: Provided that the decisions of Council of Ministers, the reasons thereof, and the material on the basis of which the decisions were taken shall be made public after the decision has been taken, and the matter is complete, or over: Provided further that those matters which come under the exemptions specified in this section shall not be disclosed;\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n24\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nProvided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\\n\\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923) nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-section (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.\\n\\n(3) Subject to the provisions of clauses (a), (c) and (i) of sub-section (1), any information relating to any occurrence, event or matter which has taken place, occurred or happened twenty years before the date on which any request is made under section 6 shall be provided to any person making a request under that section: Provided that where any question arises as to the date from which the said period of twenty years has to be computed, the decision of the Central Government shall be final, subject to the usual appeals provided for in this Act.”\\n\\n53. The information sought for by the respondents from the petitioner- Bank have been denied mainly on the ground that such information is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(a)(d) and (e) of the RTI Act.\\n\\n54. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner-Bank mainly relied upon Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act taking the stand that the Reserve Bank of India having fiduciary relationship with the other banks and that there is no reason to disclose such information as no larger public interest warrants such disclosure. The primary question therefore, is, whether the Reserve Bank of India has rightly refused to disclose information on the ground of its fiduciary relationship with the banks.\\n\\n55. The Advanced Law Lexicon, 3rd Edition, 2005, defines fiduciary relationship as \"a relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of the other on the matters within the scope of the fiduciary relationship. Fiduciary relationship usually arise in one of the four situations (1) when one person places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result gains superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes control and responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty to act or give advice to another on matters falling within the scope of the relationship, or (4) when there is specific relationship that has traditionally be recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a lawyer and a client, or a stockbroker and a customer.”\\n\\n56. The scope of the fiduciary relationship consists of the following rules:\\n\\n“(i) No Conflict rule- A fiduciary must not place himself in a position where his own interests conflicts with that of his customer or the beneficiary. There must be “real sensible possibility of conflict.\\n\\n(ii) No profit rule- a fiduciary must not profit from his position at the expense of his customer, the beneficiary;\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n25\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n(iii) Undivided loyalty rule- a fiduciary owes undivided loyalty to the beneficiary, not to place himself in a position where his duty towards one person conflicts with a duty that he owes to another customer. A consequence of this duty is that a fiduciary must make available to a customer all the information that is relevant to the customer’s affairs\\n\\n(iv) Duty of confidentiality- a fiduciary must only use information obtained in confidence and must not use it for his own advantage, or for the benefit of another person.”\\n\\n57. The term fiduciary relationship has been well discussed by this Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education and Anr. vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay and Ors. (supra). In the said decision, their Lordships referred various authorities to ascertain the meaning of the term fiduciary relationship and observed thus:-\\n\\n“20.1) Black’s Law Dictionary (7th Edition, Page 640) defines ‘fiduciary relationship’ thus:\\n\\n“A relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of the other on matters within the scope of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships – such as trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, agent- principal, and attorney-client – require the highest duty of care. Fiduciary relationships usually arise in one of four situations : (1) when one person places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result gains superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes control and responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty to act for or give advice to another on matters falling within the scope of the relationship, or (4) when there is a specific relationship that has traditionally been recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a lawyer and a client or a stockbroker and a customer.” 20.2) The American Restatements (Trusts and Agency) define ‘fiduciary’ as one whose intention is to act for the benefit of another as to matters relevant to the relation between them. The Corpus Juris Secundum (Vol. 36A page 381) attempts to define fiduciary thus :\\n\\n“A general definition of the word which is sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all cases cannot well be given. The term is derived from the civil, or Roman, law. It connotes the idea of trust or confidence, contemplates good faith, rather than legal obligation, as the basis of the transaction, refers to the integrity, the fidelity, of the party trusted, rather than his credit or ability, and has been held to apply to all persons who occupy a position of peculiar confidence toward others, and to include those informal relations which exist whenever one party trusts and relies on another, as well as technical fiduciary relations.\\n\\nThe word ‘fiduciary,’ as a noun, means one who holds a thing in trust for another, a trustee, a person holding the character of a trustee, or a character analogous to that of a trustee, with respect to the trust and confidence involved in it and the scrupulous\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n26\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\ngood faith and candor which it requires; a person having the duty, created by his undertaking, to act primarily for another’s benefit in matters connected with such undertaking. Also more specifically, in a statute, a guardian, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver, conservator, or any person acting in any fiduciary capacity for any person, trust, or estate. Some examples of what, in particular connections, the term has been held to include and not to include are set out in the note.” 20.3) Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition (Vol. 16A, Page 41) defines ‘fiducial relation’ thus :\\n\\n“There is a technical distinction between a ‘fiducial relation’ which is more correctly applicable to legal relationships between parties, such as guardian and ward, administrator and heirs, and other similar relationships, and ‘confidential relation’ which includes the legal relationships, and also every other relationship wherein confidence is rightly reposed and is exercised.\\n\\nGenerally, the term ‘fiduciary’ applies to any person who occupies a position of peculiar confidence towards another. It refers to integrity and fidelity. It contemplates fair dealing and good faith, rather than legal obligation, as the basis of the transaction. The term includes those informal relations which exist whenever one party trusts and relies upon another, as well as technical fiduciary relations.” 20.4) In Bristol and West Building Society vs. Mothew [1998 Ch. 1] the term fiduciary was defined thus :\\n\\n“A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty….. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal.” 20.5) In Wolf vs. Superior Court [2003 (107) California Appeals, 4th 25] the California Court of Appeals defined fiduciary relationship as under :\\n\\n“any relationship existing between the parties to the transaction where one of the parties is duty bound to act with utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party. Such a relationship ordinarily arises where confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity of another, and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is reposed, if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence, can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interests of the other party without the latter’s knowledge and consent.”\\n\\n21. The term ‘fiduciary’ refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term ‘fiduciary relationship’ is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n27\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\n(beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or transaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party.\\n\\nThere are also certain relationships where both the parties have to act in a fiduciary capacity treating the other as the beneficiary. Examples of these are : a partner vis-à-vis another partner and an employer vis-à-vis employee. An employee who comes into possession of business or trade secrets or confidential information relating to the employer in the course of his employment, is expected to act as a fiduciary and cannot disclose it to others. Similarly, if on the request of the employer or official superior or the head of a department, an employee furnishes his personal details and information, to be retained in confidence, the employer, the official superior or departmental head is expected to hold such personal information in confidence as a fiduciary, to be made use of or disclosed only if the employee’s conduct or acts are found to be prejudicial to the employer.”\\n\\n58. In the instant case, the RBI does not place itself in a fiduciary relationship with the Financial institutions (though, in word it puts itself to be in that position) because, the reports of the inspections, statements of the bank, information related to the business obtained by the RBI are not under the pretext of confidence or trust. In this case neither the RBI nor the Banks act in the interest of each other. By attaching an additional “fiduciary” label to the statutory duty, the Regulatory authorities have intentionally or unintentionally created an in terrorem effect.\\n\\n59. RBI is a statutory body set up by the RBI Act as India’s Central Bank. It is a statutory regulatory authority to oversee the functioning of the banks and the country’s banking sector. Under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, RBI has been given powers to issue any direction to the banks in public interest, in the interest of banking policy and to secure proper management of a banking company. It has several other far- reaching statutory powers.\\n\\n60. RBI is supposed to uphold public interest and not the interest of individual banks. RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI has no legal duty to maximize the benefit of any public sector or private sector bank, and thus there is no relationship of ‘trust’ between them. RBI has a statutory duty to uphold the interest of the public at large, the depositors, the country’s economy and the banking sector. Thus, RBI ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the provisions of the RTI Act and disclose the information sought by the respondents herein.\\n\\n61. The baseless and unsubstantiated argument of the RBI that the disclosure would hurt the economic interest of the country is totally misconceived. In the impugned order, the CIC has given several reasons to state why the disclosure of the information sought by the respondents would\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n28\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nhugely serve public interest, and non-disclosure would be significantly detrimental to public interest and not in the economic interest of India. RBI’s argument that if people, who are sovereign, are made aware of the irregularities being committed by the banks then the country’s economic security would be endangered, is not only absurd but is equally misconceived and baseless.\\n\\n62. The exemption contained in Section 8(1)(e) applies to exceptional cases and only with regard to certain pieces of information, for which disclosure is unwarranted or undesirable. If information is available with a regulatory agency not in fiduciary relationship, there is no reason to withhold the disclosure of the same. However, where information is required by mandate of law to be provided to an authority, it cannot be said that such information is being provided in a fiduciary relationship. As in the instant case, the Financial institutions have an obligation to provide all the information to the RBI and such an information shared under an obligation/ duty cannot be considered to come under the purview of being shared in fiduciary relationship. One of the main characteristic of a Fiduciary relationship is “Trust and Confidence”. Something that RBI and the Banks lack between them.\\n\\n63. In the present case, we have to weigh between the public interest and fiduciary relationship (which is being shared between the RBI and the Banks). Since, RTI Act is enacted to empower the common people, the test to determine limits of Section 8 of RTI Act is whether giving information to the general public would be detrimental to the economic interests of the country? To what extent the public should be allowed to get information?\\n\\n64. In the context of above questions, it had long since come to our attention that the Public Information Officers (PIO) under the guise of one of the exceptions given under Section 8 of RTI Act, have evaded the general public from getting their hands on the rightful information that they are entitled to.\\n\\n65. And in this case the RBI and the Banks have sidestepped the General public’s demand to give the requisite information on the pretext of “Fiduciary relationship” and “Economic Interest”. This attitude of the RBI will only attract more suspicion and disbelief in them. RBI as a regulatory authority should work to make the Banks accountable to their actions.\\n\\n66. Furthermore, the RTI Act under Section 2(f) clearly provides that the inspection reports, documents etc. fall under the purview of “Information” which is obtained by the public authority (RBI) from a private body. Section 2(f), reads thus:\\n\\n“information” means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force;\\n\\n67. From reading of the above section it can be inferred that the Legislature’s intent was to make available to the general public such information which had been obtained by the public authorities from the private body. Had it been the case where only information related to public authorities was\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n29\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nto be provided, the Legislature would not have included the word “private body”. As in this case, the RBI is liable to provide information regarding inspection report and other documents to the general public.\\n\\n68. Even if we were to consider that RBI and the Financial Institutions shared a “Fiduciary Relationship”, Section 2(f) would still make the information shared between them to be accessible by the public. The facts reveal that Banks are trying to cover up their underhand actions, they are even more liable to be subjected to public scrutiny.\\n\\n69. We have surmised that many Financial Institutions have resorted to such acts which are neither clean nor transparent. The RBI in association with them has been trying to cover up their acts from public scrutiny. It is the responsibility of the RBI to take rigid action against those Banks which have been practicing disreputable business practices.\\n\\n70. From the past we have also come across financial institutions which have tried to defraud the public. These acts are neither in the best interests of the Country nor in the interests of citizens. To our surprise, the RBI as a Watch Dog should have been more dedicated towards disclosing information to the general public under the Right to Information Act.\\n\\n71. We also understand that the RBI cannot be put in a fix, by making it accountable to every action taken by it. However, in the instant case the RBI is accountable and as such it has to provide information to the information seekers under Section 10(1) of the RTI Act, which reads as under:\\n\\n“Section 10(1) Severability —Where a request for access to information is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to information which is exempt from disclosure, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, access may be provided to that part of the record which does not contain any information which is exempt from disclosure under this Act and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains exempt information.”\\n\\n72. It was also contended by learned senior counsel for the RBI that disclosure of information sought for will also go against the economic interest of the nation. The submission is wholly misconceived.\\n\\n73. Economic interest of a nation in most common parlance are the goals which a nation wants to attain to fulfil its national objectives. It is the part of our national interest, meaning thereby national interest can’t be seen with the spectacles(glasses) devoid of economic interest.\\n\\n74. It includes in its ambit a wide range of economic transactions or economic activities necessary and beneficial to attain the goals of a nation, which definitely includes as an objective economic empowerment of its citizens. It has been recognized and understood without any doubt now that one of the tool to attain this goal is to make information available to people. Because an informed citizen has the capacity to reasoned action and also to evaluate the actions of the legislature and executives, which is very important in a participative democracy and this will serve the nation’s 30\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\ninterest better which as stated above also includes its economic interests. Recognizing the significance of this tool it has not only been made one of the fundamental rights under Article 19 of the Constitution but also a Central Act has been brought into effect on 12th October 2005 as the Right to Information Act, 2005.\\n\\n75. The ideal of ‘Government by the people’ makes it necessary that people have access to information on matters of public concern. The free flow of information about affairs of Government paves way for debate in public policy and fosters accountability in Government. It creates a condition for ‘open governance’ which is a foundation of democracy.\\n\\n76. But neither the Fundamental Rights nor the Right to Information have been provided in absolute terms. The fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 Clause 1(a) are restricted under Article 19 clause 2 on the grounds of national and societal interest. Similarly Section 8, clause 1 of Right to Information Act, 2005, contains the exemption provisions where right to information can be denied to public in the name of national security and sovereignty, national economic interests, relations with foreign states etc. Thus, not all the information that the Government generates will or shall be given out to the public. It is true that gone are the days of closed doors policy making and they are not acceptable also but it is equally true that there are some information which if published or released publicly, they might actually cause more harm than good to our national interest… if not domestically it can make the national interests vulnerable internationally and it is more so possible with the dividing line between national and international boundaries getting blurred in this age of rapid advancement of science and technology and global economy. It has to be understood that rights can be enjoyed without any inhibition only when they are nurtured within protective boundaries. Any excessive use of these rights which may lead to tampering these boundaries will not further the national interest. And when it comes to national economic interest, disclosure of information about currency or exchange rates, interest rates, taxes, the regulation or supervision of banking, insurance and other financial institutions, proposals for expenditure or borrowing and foreign investment could in some cases harm the national economy, particularly if released prematurely. However, lower level economic and financial information, like contracts and departmental budgets should not be withheld under this exemption. This makes it necessary to think when or at what stage an information is to be provided i.e., the appropriate time of providing the information which will depend on nature of information sought for and the consequences it will lead to after coming in public domain.\\n\\n77. In one of the case, the respondent S.S. Vohra sought certain information in relation to the Patna Branch of ICICI Bank and advisory issued to the Hong Kong Branch of ICICI Bank. The contention of the respondent was that the Finance Minister had made a written statement on the floor of the House on 24.07.2009 that some banks like SBI, ICICI, Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank etc., were violating FEMA Guidelines for opening of accounts and categorically mentioned that the Patna Branch of ICICI Bank Ltd. had opened some fictitious accounts which were opened by fraudsters and hence an advisory note was issued to the concerned branch on December 2007 for its irregularities. The Finance Minister even mentioned that in the year 2008 the ICICI Bank Ltd. was also warned for alleged irregular dealings in securities in Hong Kong. Hence, the respondent sought such advisory note as issued by the RBI to ICICI Bank. The Central Information Commissioner in 31\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nthe impugned order considered the RBI Master Circular dated 01.07.2009 to all the commercial banks giving various directions and finally held as under :-\\n\\n“It has been contended by the Counsel on behalf of the ICICI Bank Limited that an advisory note is prepared after reliance on documents such as Inspection Reports, Scrutiny reports etc. and hence, will contain the contents of those documents too which are otherwise exempt from disclosure. We have already expressed our view in express terms that whether or not an Advisory Note shall be disclosed under the RTI Act will have to be determined on case by case basis. In some other case, for example, there may be a situation where some contents of the Advisory Note may have to be severed to such an extent that details of Inspection Reports etc. can be separated from the Note and then be provided to the RTI Applicant. Section 10 of the RTI Act leaves it open to decide each case on its merits after having satisfied ourselves whether an Advisory Note needs to be provided as it is or whether some of its contents may be severed since they may be exempted per se under the RTI Act. However, we find no reason, whatsoever, to apply Section 10 of the RTI Act in order to severe the contents of the Advisory Note issued by the RBI to the ICICI Bank Limited as the matter has already been placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha by the Hon’ble Finance Minister.\\n\\nThis is a matter of concern since it involves the violation of policy Guidelines initiated by the RBI and affects the public at large. Transparency cannot be brought overnight in any system and one can hope to witness accountability in a system only when its end users are well- educated, well-informed and well-aware. If the customers of commercial banks will remain oblivious to the violations of RBI Guidelines and standards which such banks regularly commit, then eventually the whole financial system of the country would be at a monumental loss. This can only be prevented by suo motu disclosure of such information as the penalty orders are already in public domain.”\\n\\n78. Similarly, in another case the respondent Jayantilal N. Mistry sought information from the CPIO, RBI in respect of a Cooperative Bank viz. Saraspur Nagrik Sahkari Bank Limited related to inspection report, which was denied by the CPIO on the ground that the information contained therein were received by RBI in a fiduciary capacity and are exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act. The CIC directed the petitioner to furnish that information since the RBI expressed their willingness to disclose a summary of substantive part of the inspection report to the respondent. While disposing of the appeal the CIC observed:- “Before parting with this appeal, we would like to record our observations that in a rapidly unfolding economics scenario, there are public institutions, both in the banking and non-banking sector, whose activities have not served public interest. On the contrary, some such institutions may have attempted to defraud the public of their moneys kept with such institutions in trust. RBI being the Central Bank is one of the instrumentalities available to the public which as a regulator can inspect such institutions and initiate remedial measures where necessary. It is important that the general public, particularly, the share holders and the depositors of such institutions\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n32\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nare kept aware of RBI’s appraisal of the functioning of such institutions and taken into confidence about the remedial actions initiated in specific cases. This will serve the public interest. The RBI would therefore be well advised to be proactive in disclosing information to the public in general and the information seekers under the RTI Act, in particular. The provisions of Section 10(1) of the RTI Act can therefore be judiciously used when necessary to adhere to this objective.”\\n\\n79. In another case, where the respondent P.P. Kapoor sought information inter alia about the details of default in loans taken from public sector banks by industrialists, out of the list of defaulters, top 100 defaulters, names of the businessmen, firm name, principal amount, interest amount, date of default and date of availing the loan etc. The said information was denied by the CPIO mainly on the basis that it was held in fiduciary capacity and was exempt from disclosure of such information. Allowing the appeal, the CIC directed for the disclosure of such information. The CIC in the impugned order has rightly observed as under:- “I wish government and its instrumentalities would remember that all information held by them is owned by citizens, who are sovereign. Further, it is often seen that banks and financial institutions continue to provide loans to industrialists despite their default in repayment of an earlier loan.” This Court in UP Financial Corporation vs. Gem Cap India Pvt. Ltd., AIR 1993 SC 1435 has noted that :\\n\\n“Promoting industrialization at the cost of public funds does not serve the public interest, it merely amounts to transferring public money to private account’. Such practices have led citizens to believe that defaulters can get away and play fraud on public funds. There is no doubt that information regarding top industrialists who have defaulted in repayment of loans must be brought to citizens’ knowledge; there is certainly a larger public interest that could be served on ….disclosure of the same. In fact, information about industrialists who are loan defaulters of the country may put pressure on such persons to pay their dues. This would have the impact of alerting Citizens about those who are defaulting in payments and could also have some impact in shaming them.\\n\\nRBI had by its Circular DBOD No. BC/CIS/47/20.16.002/94 dated April 23, 1994 directed all banks to send a report on their defaulters, which it would share with all banks and financial institutions, with the following objectives:\\n\\nTo alert banks and financial institutions (FIs) and to put them on guard against borrowers who have defaulted in their dues to lending institutions;\\n\\nTo make public the names of the borrowers who have defaulted and against whom suits have been filed by banks/ FIs.”\\n\\n80. At this juncture, we may refer the decision of this Court in Mardia Chemicals Limited vs. Union of India, (2004) 4 SCC 311, wherein this court while considering the validity of SARFAESI Act and\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86904342/\\n\\n33\\n\\nReserve Bank Of India vs Jayantilal N. Mistry on 16 December, 2015\\n\\nrecovery of non- performing assets by banks and financial institutions in India, held :-\\n\\n“………….it may be observed that though the transaction may have a character of a private contract yet the question of great importance behind such transactions as a whole having far reaching effect on the economy of the country cannot be ignored, purely restricting it to individual transactions more particularly when financing is through banks and financial institutions utilizing the money of the people in general namely, the depositors in the banks and public money at the disposal of the financial institutions. Therefore, wherever public interest to such a large extent is involved and it may become necessary to achieve an object which serves the public purposes, individual rights may have to give way. Public interest has always been considered to be above the private interest. Interest of an individual may, to some extent, be affected but it cannot have the potential of taking over the public interest having an impact in the socio- economic drive of the country………..”\\n\\n81. In rest of the cases the CIC has considered elaborately the information sought for and passed orders which in our opinion do not suffer from any error of law, irrationality or arbitrariness.\\n\\n82. We have, therefore, given our anxious consideration to the matter and came to the conclusion that the Central Information Commissioner has passed the impugned orders giving valid reasons and the said orders, therefore, need no interference by this Court.\\n\\n83. There is no merit in all these cases and hence they are dismissed.\\n\\n…………………………….J. (M.Y. Eqbal) …………………………….J. (C.

Gross Income/Net income of my wife. Sonal Dhingra – PAN No. BAOPD5266L from AY 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021- 22.”\\n\\nThe CPIO furnished a reply to the appellant on 02.02.2023 and denied the information under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act.\\n\\nBeing dissatisfied, the appellant filed a First Appeal dated 16.02.2023. FAA’s order, dated 07.02.2023, upheld the reply of the CPIO with the following observation-\\n\\n“As discussed above, the application was disposed off by the concerned CPIO, ITO Ward 58(7), New Delhi and information was rightly denied in view of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court decision in the case of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs Central Information Commission & Ors (SLP 27734 of 2012 dated 03.10.2012 and since information relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and disposed of accordingly.”\\n\\nFeeling aggrieved and dissatisfied, the appellant approached the Commission with the instant Second Appeal.\\n\\nRelevant Facts emerging during Hearing: The following were present:-\\n\\nAppellant: Represented by Adv. Anmol Malhotra present in person. Respondent: Prem Prakash Mehra, ITO Ward 58(7) & CPIO present in person. Third Party: Represented by Anuj Dhingra, present in person.\\n\\nThe written submissions filed by the Appellant and the Respondent prior to the hearing are taken on record.\\n\\nThe Appellant stated that he has sought the income related details of his estranged wife to corroborate evidence pertaining to a maintenance case pending against him before the Court of Law. However, he is aggrieved with the fact that the information was wrongly denied by the CPIO under the garb of Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act. He urged the Commission for relief to be granted in the matter.\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe CPIO submitted that since the information sought by the Appellant pertains to the personal information of the third party; therefore, it was denied to him by invoking Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act.\\n\\nThe Rep. of third party stated that since such records have already been produced before the Civil Court during pendency of maintenance case; therefore, seeking such information through RTI channel won’t serve any public interest, as such.\\n\\nDecision:\\n\\nAt the outset, it is noteworthy that this bench has dealt with cases bearing the same factual matrix and the stance that has been maintained by it so far is that the information sought for in the RTI Application pertains to the personal information of a third party and stands duly exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. In this regard, the attention of the Appellant(s) has been drawn towards a judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India Vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal in Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 with Civil Appeal No. 10045 of 2010 and Civil Appeal No. 2683 of 2010 wherein the import of “personal information” envisaged under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act has been exemplified in the context of earlier ratios laid down by the same Court in the matter(s) of Canara Bank Vs. C.S. Shyam in Civil Appeal No.22 of 2009; Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs. Central Information Commissioner & Ors., (2013) 1 SCC 212 and R.K. Jain vs. Union of India & Anr., (2013) 14 SCC 794. The following was thus held:\\n\\n“59. Reading of the aforesaid judicial precedents, in our opinion, would indicate that personal records, including name, address, physical, mental and psychological status, marks obtained, grades and answer sheets, are all treated as personal information. Similarly, professional records, including qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information. Medical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of hospitals and doctors visited, findings recorded, including that of the family members, information relating to assets, lending and liabilities, borrowing, etc. are personal information. Such personal information is entitled to protection from unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional\\n\\nincome tax returns, details of\\n\\ninvestments,\\n\\n3\\n\\naccess is available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied. This list is indicative and not exhaustive…”\\n\\nFurther, in matters concerning the disputes of a husband and wife, the Commission is guided by a judgment of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in the matter of Vijay Prakash vs. Union of India (W.P. (C) 803/2009) dated 01.07.2009 wherein the Court observed that in private disputes such as the present one between a husband and wife “…The basic protection afforded by virtue of the exemption (from disclosure) enacted under Section 8(1)(j) cannot be lifted or disturbed..”\\n\\nSimilarly, in the matter of Madhumala B. R. vs. ACIT, Ward 3(3)(1), Bangalore based on the same facts in File No. CIC/CCITB/A/2021/609570, the attention of this bench was invited to the following cases filed by the Income Tax authorities in Bangalore with the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka against the orders of the Commission wherein “gross income” of the spouse was allowed to be disclosed citing the right of maintenance:\\n\\n1. Jammula Padma Manjari in W.P. No. 18778 of 2017 (CIC/BS/A/2016/001440-BJ) 2. Gulsanober Bano in W.P. No. 34625 of 2019 (CIC/CCITB/A/2017/180340-BJ) 3. Neena Bhatnagar Mani in W.P. No. 7367 of 2020 (CIC/CCITB/A/2018/106268-BJ)\\n\\n4. Chhavi Goel Nee Agarwal in W.P. No. 7281 of 2020 (CIC/CCITB/A/2018/120646-BJ) 5. Devyani Lakher in W.P. No. 7453 of 2020 (CIC/PNBNK/A/2018/104442) 6. Princy Amit Jain in W.P. No. 11233 of 2020 (CIC/CCITB/A/2018/164565).\\n\\nNonetheless, since the averred Court cases are reportedly under an interim stay by the Karnataka High Court and the details of the arguments or further orders are not available on record, this bench has accepted the bar on disclosure thus far only in the Madhumala case.\\n\\nPer contra, in the recent past this bench has met with the continuing reliance placed by a staggering number of applicants on the decision dated 06.11.2020 of a coordinate bench of the Commission in the Rahmat Bano case, wherein the disclosure of the gross income was allowed to the estranged wife on the ground of sustenance and livelihood of the family. The said decision was premised on the judgments of two High Courts i.e in the matter of Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Pawan Kumar Jain and others W.A. No. 168/2015 and Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and others W.A. No. 170/2015 dated 15.05.2018 by Hon’ble MP High Court as well as Rajesh Ramachandra Kidile vs. Maharashtra SIC and Ors in\\n\\n4\\n\\nW.P. No. 1766 of 2016 dated 22.10.2018 by Hon’ble High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench). Thus, while making a reference to the ratio laid down in the Apex Court judgement in the Girish Ramachandra (supra) case it was held as under in the Rahmat Bano case:\\n\\n“However, making a distinction with the said judgment, the Division Bench of the Hon\\'ble High Court of M.P. in the matter of Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Pawan Kumar Jain and others W.A. No. 168/2015 and Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and others W.A. No. 170/2015 dated 15.05.2018 had in a matter where the information seeker had sought the salary details of her husband from the employer held as under:\\n\\n\"While dealing with the Section 8(1)(j) of the Act, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the appellant and the respondent No.1 are husband and wife and as a wife she is entitled to know what remuneration the respondent No.1 is getting. Present case is distinguishable from the case of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) and therefore the law laid down by their Lordships in the case of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) are not applicable in the present case. In view of the foregoing discussion, we allow the appeal and set aside the order passed by the Writ Court in W.P. No.341/2008. Similarly, the W.A. No.170/2015 is also allowed and the impugned order passed in W.P. No.1647/2008 is set aside.\"\\n\\n8. Moreover, the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench) in the matter of Rajesh Ramachandra Kidile vs. Maharashtra SIC and Ors in W.P. No. 1766 of 2016 dated 22.10.2018 held as under:\\n\\n“8. Perusal of this application shows that the salary slips for the period mentioned in the application have been sought for by the Advocate. As rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the salary slips contain such details as deductions made from the salary, remittances made to the Bank by way of loan instalments, remittances made to the Income Tax Authority towards part payment of the Income Tax for the concerned month and other details relating to contributions made to Provident Fund, etc. It is here that the information contained in the salary slips as having the characteristic of personal nature. Any information which discloses, as for Income tax Department towards example, remittances made to the discharge of tax liability or to the Bank towards discharge of loan liability would constitute the personal information and would encroach upon the\\n\\n5\\n\\nprivacy of the person. Therefore as held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Girish Ramachandra Deshpande (supra) such an information could not be disclosed under the provisions of the RTI Act. This is all the more so when the information seeker is a person who is totally stranger in blood or marital relationship to the person whose information he wants to lay his hands on. It would have been a different matter, had the information been sought by the wife of the petitioner in order to support her contention in a litigation, which she filed against her husband. In a litigation, where the issue involved is of maintenance of wife, the information relating to the salary details no longer remain confined to the category of personal information concerning both husband and wife, which is available with the husband hence accessible by the wife. But in the present case, as stated earlier, the application has not been filed by the wife.\\n\\n9. Then, by the application filed under the provisions of the RTI Act, information regarding mere gross salary of the petitioner has not been sought and what have been sought are the details if the salary such as amounts relating to gross salary, take home salary and also all the deductions from the gross salary. It is such nature of the information sought which takes the present case towards the category of exempted information.\\n\\n10. All these aspects of the matter have not been considered by the authority below and, therefore, I find that its order is patently illegal, not sustainable in the eyes of law.”\\n\\n9. Taking into consideration the aforementioned analysis and the judgments of the Higher Courts, the Commission directs the respondent to inform the appellant about the generic details of the net taxable income/gross income of her husband held and available with the Public Authority for the period 2017- 2018, within a period of 15 working days from the date of receipt of this order. Emphasis Supplied\\n\\n10. The details/copy of income tax returns and other personal information of third party need not to be disclosed to the appellant except as mentioned at para no. 9 above.”\\n\\nTherefore, applying the same yardsticks in favour of the husbands in pursuance of the Appellant’s plea during the hearing that the information is being requested for corroborating the evidence in a maintenance case pending against him, the\\n\\n6\\n\\nCommission directs the CPIO to provide only the “generic details of the net taxable income/gross income” of the Appellant’s wife for the specified time period as contained in the RTI Application to the Appellant free of cost within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order.

The present writ petition is directed against the decision of the Central Information Commission ( h e r e i n a f t e r r e f e r r e d t o a s t h e \" C I C \" ) d a t e d 1 2 . 0 1 . 2 0 1 1 p a s s e d i n A p p e a l N o . CIC/WB/A/2009/001004- SM, preferred under Section 19 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\") whereby the petitioner has been directed to provide the relevant records in its possession as sought by the Respondent herein.\\n\\n2. The respondent by an application filed under Section 6 of the Act, sought the following Information from the petitioner:\\n\\n\"A. Please provide inspection of the records, documents, note sheets, manuscripts, records, reports, office memorandum, part files and files relating to the proposed disciplinary action and/or imposition of penalty against Shri G.S. Narang, IRS,\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n1\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nCentral Excise and customs Officer of 1974 Batch and also inspection of records, files, etc., relating to the decision of the UPSC thereof. Shri G.S. Narang is presently posted as Director General of Inspection Customs and Central Excise.\\n\\nB. Please provide copies of all the note sheets and the final decision taken regarding imposition of penalty/ disciplinary action and decision of the UPSC thereof.\"\\n\\n3. The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the petitioner, however, declined to provide the same on the ground that the information sought pertained to the disciplinary case of Shri G. S. Narang, which was of personal nature, disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest. It further stated that the disclosure of the same may infringe upon the privacy of the individual and that it may not be in the larger interest. The petitioner, therefore, claimed exemption from disclosing the information under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n4. The Respondent, consequently, filed an appeal under Section 19 of the Act, before the 1st Appellate Authority of the Petitioner. The Appellate Authority dismissed the Appeal on the same ground that the information sought was exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n5. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Respondent preferred an appeal before the CIC. Setting aside the decision of the „First Appellate Authority(cid:129), the CIC held as follows:\\n\\n\"4. After carefully considering the facts of the case and the submissions made by both parties, we are of the view that the CPIO was not right in denying this information. As far as the UPSC is concerned, the Respondent informed, it receives references from the Ministries and Departments in disciplinary matters to give its comments and recommendations on individual cases. In this case too, the UPSC had been consulted and that it had offered its comments and views to the Government. Whatever records it holds in regard to this case will have to be disclosed because this cannot be classified as personal information merely on the ground that it concerns some particular officer. Our attention was drawn to a Division Bench ruling by the High Court of Kerala in the WA No. 2781/2009 in which the Court had held that the information sought by an employee, from his employer, in respect of domestic enquiry and confidential reports of his colleagues would not amount to personal information as provided under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act. In other words, information regarding the disciplinary matters against any employee cannot be withheld by claiming it to be personal Information.\\n\\n5. In the light of the above, we direct the CPIO to invite the Appellant on any mutually convenient date within 15 working days from the receipt of this order and to show him the relevant records in the possession of the UPSC for his inspection. After Inspection, if the Appellant chooses to get the photocopies of some of those records, the CPIO shall provide the same free of cost.\" (emphasis supplied) Petitioner\\'s Submissions\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n2\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n6. The Petitioner assails the decision of the CIC, in the present writ petition, on several grounds. The Petitioner submits that the information sought by the Respondent at point „A(cid:129) of his RTI application is not with the Petitioner. It is stated by the Petitioner that the said information relates to the actions of the concerned Ministry/ Department and as such no record thereof is available or held with the Petitioner. As regards rest of the Information sought by the Respondent, it is submitted that the same is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(e), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(j) of the Act. The relevant extract of Section 8 of the Act reads as follows: \"Section 8 - Exemption from disclosure of information (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,--\\n\\nx x x x x x x x x\\n\\n(e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\nx x x x x x x x x\\n\\n(g) information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes;\\n\\nx x x x x x x x x\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\\n\\nProvided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person;\\n\\nx x x x x x x x x\"\\n\\n7. The Petitioner claims exemption under Section 8 (1)(j) of the Act on the basis that the disclosure of the information sought would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the concerned charged officer.\\n\\nThe Petitioner also submits that disclosure would not serve any larger public interest and would rather expose and make public- vulnerable and sensitive information relating to third party(s). The petitioner submits that the CIC erred in relying upon the decision of the Kerala High Court in WA\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n3\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nNo. 2781/2009 titled Centre for Earth Science Studies vs. Dr. Mrs. Anson Sebastian & the State Information Commission.\\n\\n8. It is submitted by the Petitioner that the information sought for by the Respondent includes not only information that is personal to a third party i.e. the charged officer, but also contains information relating to the particular views and opinions of persons/ officers who contributed to the disciplinary proceedings against the charged officer. This opinion was given in trust and confidence and as such is held by the Petitioner in its fiduciary capacity, and is thereby exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act. It is submitted that file notings pertaining to disciplinary cases are exempt from disclosure under the aforesaid section. To further his submission, the petitioner has placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court in W.P. (C) No. 12367/2009 and LPA No. 418/2010 titled Ravinder Kumar vs. Central Information Commission & Ors., the judgment of the Supreme Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs. Shaunak H. Satya and others, (2011) 8 SCC 781, and; the decision of the CIC in Shri K.L. Balbani vs. Directorate General of Vigilance, Customs & Central Excise dt. 16.09.2009.\\n\\n9. Further, it is submitted that the disclosure of such information besides endangering the life and safety of the persons concerned, will also disclose the assistance that was given by the officers during the Disciplinary proceeding for enforcement of law. Consequently, it is argued, that the disclosure of the information sought would be exempt under Section 8(1)(g) of the Act.\\n\\n10. The Petitioner contends that order of the CIC is unsustainable in law in as much, as, it is contrary to the decisions of the concurrent Benches of the CIC. Moreover, it has rendered its decision while this Court is seized of a similar issue in W.P. (C) No. 13205/2009 titled UPSC vs. C.L. Sharma.\\n\\nRespondent\\'s Submissions\\n\\n11. The Respondent, on the other hand, has at the outset submitted that the CIC has merely directed the disclosure of the records in possession of the UPSC. It has not directed the Petitioner to procure records from the concerned Ministries or Departments and then to make them available to the Respondent for inspection.\\n\\n12. The Respondent submits that the information directed to be disclosed to the Respondent, by the Impugned order, is not exempted under Section 8 (1)(e), 8(1)(g), or 8(1)(j) of the Act. It is further submitted that the CPIO and the first Appellate Authority had merely claimed exemption under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act, and that the Petitioner cannot, at this stage, be permitted to introduce new grounds by claiming exemption under Section 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(e) of the Act. It is also contented that there is no fiduciary relationship involved in the present case and the disclosure of information would not endanger the life and safety of anyone. Hence, the information sought is not exempt under Section 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(g) of the Act. It is also submitted that the exemption under Section 8(1)(e) and (j) is not available as it would be in the larger public interest to disclose the same.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n4\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n13. As regards the exemption under Section 8(1)(j), it is submitted by the Respondent that disclosure of the information permitted by the impugned order relates to the public activity of public servants. It can, by no stretch of imagination, be treated as personal information of a Public Servant. The information sought is not personal information relating to a third party, but is contained in the records of the UPSC itself. It is further submitted that the disclosure of the information sought is in the larger public interest, since the case not only relates to serious irregularities committed in the administration of taxation cases and adjudication of offence, but also involves different opinions given by two public authorities, i.e. the Central Vigilance Commission and the Petitioner on the basis of the same records, thereby making it necessary to see whether same or different records were produced or any part of the records were withheld from or by the Petitioner, and also whether a proper method and procedure was adopted by the Petitioner. It is contented that the disclosure would promote transparency and accountability, thereby adding to the credibility to the Petitioner itself.\\n\\n14. The Respondent submits that the judgment of this Court in Ravinder Kumar (Supra), relied upon by the petitioner, have no applicability to the present case and that the CIC has rightly followed the judgment of the Kerala High Court in Centre for Earth Science Studies (Supra). It is also submitted that the mere pendency of some similar matter before this Court would not preclude the CIC to decide the appeal pending before it. Discussion\\n\\n15. The principal contention of the Petitioner, right from the stage when the RTI application was considered by the CPIO up till the stage of consideration of the Second Appeal before the CIC, was that the information sought for by the Respondent is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. Therefore, I proceed to deal with it first.\\n\\n16. The exemption under Section 8(1)(j) is available in respect of „personal information(cid:129) of an individual. For the exemption to come into operation, the personal information sought:\\n\\n(i) Should not have relation to any public activity, or to public interest OR,\\n\\n(ii) Should be such as to cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. However, the exemption is not available in a case where larger public interest justifies such disclosure.\\n\\n17. The word „personal(cid:129) means appertaining to the person; belonging to an individual; limited to the person; having the nature or partaking of the qualities of human beings, or of movable property. [See Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition].\\n\\n18. The word „information(cid:129) is defined in Section 2(f) of the Act as meaning:\\n\\n\"any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers,\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n5\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nsamples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force\".\\n\\n19. Therefore, \"personal information\" under the Act, would be information, as set forth above, that pertains to a person. As such it takes into its fold possibly every kind of information relating to the person. Now, such personal information of the person may, or may not, have relation to any public activity, or to public interest. At the same time, such personal information may, or may not, be private to the person.\\n\\n20. The term \"personal information\" under section 8(1)(j) does not mean information relating to the information seeker, or the public authority, but about a third party. The section exempts from disclosure personal information, including that which would cause \"unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual\". If one were to seek information about himself, the question of invasion of his own privacy would not arise. It would only arise where the information sought relates to a third party. Consequently, the exemption under Section 8(1)(j) is as regards third party personal information only.\\n\\n21. Further, the personal information cannot be that of a \"public authority\". No public authority can claim that any information held by it is personal to it. There is nothing \"personal\" about any information held by a public authority in relation to itself. The expression \"personal information\" used in Section 8(1)(j) means information personal to any \"person\", that the public authority may hold. For instance, a public authority may in connection with its functioning require any other person to provide information which may be personal to that person. It is that information, pertaining to that other person, which the public authority may refuse to disclose, if the information sought satisfies the conditions set out in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act, i.e., if such information has no relationship to any public activity (of the person who has provided the information, or who is the source of the information, or to whom that information pertains), or to public interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual (unless larger public interest justifies disclosure). The use of the words \"invasion of the privacy of the individual\", instead of \"an individual\", shows that the legislative intent was to connect the expression \"personal information\" with the word \"individual\".\\n\\n22. Merely because information that may be personal to a third party is held by a public authority, a querist does not become entitled to access it, unless the said personal information has a relationship to a public activity of the third person (to whom it relates), or to public interest. If it is private informtaion (i.e. it is personal information which impinges on the privacy of the third party), its disclosure would not be made unless larger public interest dictates it. Therefore, for example, a querist cannot seek the personal or private particulars provided by a third party in his application made to the passport authorities in his application to obtain a passport, merely because such information is available with the passport authorities, which is a public authority under the Act. The querist must make out a case (in his application under Section 6 of the Act) justifying the disclosure of the information sought on the touchstone of clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act. 6\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n23. Proceeding further, I now examine the expressions „Public activity(cid:129), „Public interest(cid:129) and „Privacy of the individual(cid:129) used in Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n24. „Public activity(cid:129) qua a person are those activities which are performed by the person in discharge of a public duty, i.e. in the public domain. There is an inherent public interest involved in the discharge of such activities, as all public duties are expected to be discharged in public interest. Consequently, information of a person which is related to, or has a bearing on his public activities, is not exempt from disclosure under the scheme and provisions of the Act, whose primary object is to ensure an informed citizenry and transparency of information and also to contain corruption. For example, take the case of a surgeon employed in a Government Hospital who performs surgeries on his patients who are coming to the government hospital. His personal information, relating to discharge of his public duty, i.e. his public activity, is not exempt from disclosure under the Act. Such information could include information relating to his physical and mental health, his qualifications etc., as the said information has a bearing on the discharge of his public duty, but would not include his other personal information such as, his taste in music, sport, art, his family, his family background etc., which has no bearing/relation to his act of performing his duties as a surgeon.\\n\\n25. \"Public interest\" is also a ground for taking away the exemption from disclosure of personal information. Therefore, a querist may seek personal information of a person from a public authority in public interest. The second half of the first part of clause (j) of Section 8(1) shows that when personal information in respect of a person is sought, the authority concerned shall weigh the competing claims i.e., the claim for the protection of personal information of the concerned person on the one hand, and the claim of public interest on the other, and if \"public interest\" justifies disclosure, i.e., the public interest outweighs the need for protection of personal information, the concerned authority shall disclose the information.\\n\\n26. For example, a querist may seek from the income tax authorities- the details of the income tax returns filed by private individual/juristic entity - if the querist can justify the disclosure of such personal information on the anvil of public interest. The authorities would, in such cases, be cautious to ensure that the ground of \"public interest\" is not routinely used as a garb by busy bodies to pry on the personal affairs of individual private citizens/entities, as it would be against public interest (and not in public interest) to permit such personal information of third parties to fall into the hands of anybody or everybody.\\n\\n27. At this stage, I may digress a little and observe that whenever the querist applicant wishes to seek information, the disclosure of which can be made only upon existence of certain special circumstances, for example- the existence of public interest, the querist should in the application (moved under Section 6 of the Act) disclose/ plead the special circumstance, so that the PIO concerned can apply his mind to it, and, in case he decides to issue notice to the concerned third party under Section 11 of the Act, the third party is able to effectively deal with the same. Only then the PIO/appellate authority/CIC would be able to come to an informed decision whether, or not, the special circumstances exist in a given case.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n7\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n28. I may also observe that public interest does not mean that which is interesting as gratifying curiosity or love of information or amusement; but that in which a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their rights or liabilities are affected. The expression \"public interest\" is not capable of a precise definition and has not a rigid meaning and is elastic and takes its colors from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with the time and the state of the society and its needs. [See Advanced Law Lexicon, Third Edition].\\n\\n29. The second part of clause (j) of Section 8(1) appears to deal with the scope of defence founded on the right of privacy of an individual. The tussle between the right of privacy of an individual and the right of others to seek information which may impinge on the said right of privacy, is what the said clause seeks to address.\\n\\n30. The right to privacy means the right to be left alone and the right of a person to be free from unwarranted publicity. Black(cid:129)s Law Dictionary says that the terms „right to privacy(cid:129) is a generic term encompassing various rights recognized to be inherent in concept of ordered liberty, and such rights prevent government interference in intimate personal relationship(cid:129)s or activities, freedoms of individual to make fundamental choices involving himself, his family, and his relationship with others. A man has the right to pass through this world, if he wills, without having his picture published, his business enterprises discussed, his successful experiments written for the benefit of others, or his eccentricities commented upon by any means or mode. It is based on the theory that everyone has the right of inviolability of the person.\\n\\n31. The \"right to privacy\", even though by itself has not been defined by our Constitution and though, as a concept, it may be too broad to define judicially, the Supreme Court has recognised by its liberal interpretation that \"right to privacy\" is an integral part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\\n\\n32. In Rajagopal vs. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1995 SC 264, the Supreme Court had the occasion to comment on the origin, basis, nature and scope of the right to privacy in India. Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy, referred to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Kharak Singh and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors., 1964 (1) SCR 332: AIR 1963 SC 129 and the decision in Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 1975 (2) SCC 148: AIR 1975 SC 1378. In the later case, Mathew, J., speaking for himself, Krishna Iyer and Goswami, JJ. traced the origins of this right and also pointed out how the said right has been dealt with by the United States Supreme Court in two of its well-known decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, [1965] 385 U.S. 479 : 14 L.Ed. 2d. 510 and Roe v. Wade, [1973] 410 U.S. 113. After referring to Kharak Singh (supra) and the said American decisions, the learned Judge stated the law in the following words: \"...privacy-dignity claims deserve to be examined with care and to be denied only when an important countervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the compelling State interest test....\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n8\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n...privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in autonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and values.\\n\\nAny right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child rearing. This catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as instructive as it does not give analytical picture of the distinctive characterstics of the right of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty....\\n\\nThere are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home. The first is that activities in the home harm others only to the extent that they cause offence resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging in such activities and that such \\'harm\\' is not constitutionally protectible by the State. The second is that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can be free from societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting on the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves, an image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than the realities of their natures. [See 26 Stanford Law Rev. 1161, 1187] The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the right is absolute.\\n\\nThe European Convention on Human Rights, which came into force on September 3, 1953, represents a valiant attempt to tackle the new problem. Article 8 of the Convention is worth citing [See \"Privacy and Human Rights\", Ed. AH robertson, p. 176]:\\n\\n1. Every one has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\\n\\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"\\n\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n9\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n33. Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy, summarized the concept of right to privacy as under:\\n\\n\"(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. It is a \"right to be let alone\". A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters.\\n\\nNone can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent - whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\\n\\n(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interest of decency [Article 19 (2)] an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in press/media.\\n\\n(3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above - indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for contempt of court and the Parliament and Legislatures protected as their privileges are by Articles 105 and 104 respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.\" (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n34. It follows that the „privacy(cid:129) of a person, or in other words his „private information(cid:129), encompasses the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, child rearing and of the like nature. „Personal information(cid:129), on the other hand, as aforesaid, would be information, in any form, that pertains to an individual. Therefore, „private information(cid:129) is a part of „personal information(cid:129). All that is private is personal, but all that is personal may not be private. A person has a right to keep his private information, or in other words, his privacy guarded 10\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nfrom disclosure. It is this right which has come to be recognised as fundamental to a person(cid:129)s life and liberty, and is accordingly protected from unwarranted/unauthorised invasion under the Act, and can be overridden only in „larger(cid:129) public interest.\\n\\n35. The use of the expression \"unwarranted\" before \"invasion of the privacy of the individual\" and the expression \"larger\" before \"public interest\" needs attention. The use of \"unwarranted\", as aforesaid, shows that the PIO, Appellate Authority or the CIC, as the case may be, should come to a definite finding upon application of mind to all the relevant considerations and submissions of the querist and the third party - whose privacy is at stake, that the disclosure of the information, which would cause invasion of the privacy of the individual is warranted, in the facts of the case. He should, therefore, come to the conclusion that even after application of the principle of severability (contained in Section 10 of the Act), it is necessary to disclose the personal and private information in larger public interest. The expression \"larger public interest\" connotes that the public interest that is sought to be addressed by the disclosure of the private information, serves a large section of the public, and not just a small section thereof. Therefore, if the information has a bearing on the state of the economy; the moral values in the society; the environment; national safety, or the like, the same would qualify as \"larger public interest\".\\n\\n36. Take for instance, a case where a person is employed to work in an orphanage or a children(cid:129)s home having small children as inmates. The employer may or may not be a public authority under the Act. That person, i.e. the employee, has a background of child abuse, for which he has undergone psychiatric treatment in a government hospital. A querist could seek information regarding the medical and psychiatric treatment undergone by the person concerned from the government hospital where the person has undergone treatment, in larger public interest, even though the said information is not only personal, but private, vis-à-vis. the employee. The larger public interest in such a case would lay in protecting the children living in the orphanage/ children(cid:129)s home from possible child abuse.\\n\\n37. In light of the above discussion, the following principles emerge for the exemption under Section 8(1)(j) to apply:\\n\\n(i) The information sought must relate to „Personal information(cid:129) as understood above of a third party.\\n\\nTherefore, if the information sought does not qualify as personal information, the exemption would not apply;\\n\\n(ii) Such personal information should relate to a third person, i.e., a person other than the information seeker or the public authority; AND\\n\\n(iii) (a) The information sought should not have a relation to any public activity qua such third person, or to public interest. If the information sought relates to public activity of the third party, i.e. to his activities falling within the public domain, the exemption would not apply. Similarly, if the disclosure of the personal information is found justified in public interest, the exemption would be\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n11\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nlifted, otherwise not;\\n\\nOR\\n\\n(iii) (b) The disclosure of the information would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual, and that there is no larger public interest involved in such disclosure.\\n\\n38. Let us now examine the claim of exemption under Section 8(1)(j) in the present case, in view of the aforesaid principles. The information sought by the Respondent relates to the proposed disciplinary action and/or imposition of penalty against Shri G.S. Narang, IRS, Central Excise and Customs Officer of 1974 Batch and the decision/recommendation of the Petitioner communicated to the concerned Ministry.\\n\\n39. The Petitioner in the present case, being a constitutional body and thereby a \"public authority\" under the Act, cannot claim the exemption of personal information qua itself and its officials under Section 8(1)(j). Even otherwise, its act of tendering advice to the concerned Ministry on matters relating to disciplinary proceedings against a charged officer is in discharge of a public duty entrusted to it by the law itself, and is thereby a public activity. Consequently, the defence is also not available to the officers of the Petitioner with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties.\\n\\n40. The information sought, in the present case, also does not relate to the privacy of the charged officer. Disciplinary inquiry of the charged officer is with regard to the alleged irregularities committed by him while discharging public duties and public functions. The disclosure of such information cannot be regarded as invasion of his privacy.\\n\\n41. Even otherwise, the disclosure of such information would be in the larger public interest, keeping in view the object of the Act, which is to promote transparency and accountability and also to contain corruption. The preamble of the Act, inter alia, states:\\n\\n\"An Act to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority,. .... .... ...\\n\\nAnd Whereas democracy requires an informed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed;\\n\\nAnd Whereas revelation of information in actual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information; And Whereas it is necessary to harmonise these conflicting interest while preserving the paramountancy of the democratic ideal; ... ... ...\"\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n12\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n42. This Court in LPA No. 501/2009 titled Secretary General, Supreme Court of India vs. Subhash Chandra Aggarwal, dealing with the concept of „Right to Information(cid:129) under the Act observed as under:\\n\\n\"30. Information is currency that every citizen requires to participate in the life and governance of the society. In any democratic polity, greater the access, greater will be the responsiveness, and greater the restrictions, greater the feeling of powerlessness and alienation. Information is basis for knowledge, which provokes thought, and without thinking process, there is no expression. \"Knowledge\" said James Madison, \"will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives. A popular government without popular information or the means of obtaining it is but a prologue to farce or tragedy or perhaps both\". The citizens(cid:129) right to know the facts, the true facts, about the administration of the country is thus one of the pillars of a democratic State. And that is why the demand for openness in the government is increasingly growing in different parts of the world. \"\\n\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n\\n43. The Court, while explaining the importance and need of the Right, referred to the following observation of the Supreme Court in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India, 1981 (Supp) SCC 87:\\n\\n\"65. The demand for openness in the government is based principally on two reasons. It is now widely accepted that democracy does not consist merely in people exercising their franchise once in five years to choose their rules and, once the vote is cast, then retiring in passivity and not taking any interest in the government. Today it is common ground that democracy has a more positive content and its orchestration has to be continuous and pervasive. This means inter alia that people should not only cast intelligent and rational votes but should also exercise sound judgment on the conduct of the government and the merits of public policies, so that democracy does not remain merely a sporadic exercise in voting but becomes a continuous process of government - an attitude and habit of mind. But this important role people can fulfill in a democracy only if it is an open government where there is full access to information in regard to the functioning of the government.\" (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n44. After, having referred to a sea of judgments and scholarly excerpts, the Division Bench of this Court held as follows:\\n\\n\"60. The decisions cited by the learned Attorney General on the meaning of the words \"held\" or \"control\" are relating to property and cannot be relied upon in interpretation of the provisions of the Right to Information Act. The source of right to information does not emanate from the Right to Information Act. It is a right that emerges from the constitutional guarantees under Article 19(1)(a) as held by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. The Right to Information Act is not\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n13\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\nrepository of the right to information. Its repository is the constitutional rights guaranteed under Article 19((1)(a). The Act is merely an instrument that lays down statutory procedure in the exercise of this right. Its overreaching purpose is to facilitate democracy by helping to ensure that citizens have the information required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and to help the governors accountable to the governed. In construing such a statute the Court ought to give to it the widest operation which its language will permit. The Court will also not readily read words which are not there and introduction of which will restrict the rights of citizens for whose benefit the statute is intended.\"\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n45. It is clear from the above, that the thrust of the legislation is to secure access to information under the control of public authorities in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority, unless its disclosure is exempted under the Act. The access to information is considered vital to the functioning of a democracy, as it creates an informed citizenry. Transparency of information is considered vital to contain corruption and to hold Government and its instrumentalities accountable to the governed citizens of this country.\\n\\n46. The orders of the learned Single Judge and Division Bench of this Court in Ravinder Kumar (Supra) have no relevance for a variety of reasons. The order of the learned Single Judge, upholding the claim of exemption under Section 8(1)(j) raised by the public authority- to the disclosure of note sheets containing opinions and advices rendered by officials in respect of departmental proceedings- on the ground that the same was against public interest, had been made specifically in the facts and circumstances of that case. Further, the order of the Division Bench was an order dismissing an application for restoration of the LPA. It was not an order on merits. There was no decision on any legal proposition on merits rendered by the Court in the said order. Mere prima facie observations of the Division Bench do not constitute a binding precedent. The decisions in Ravinder Kumar (supra), therefore, do not even otherwise apply in the facts of the present case.\\n\\n47. Reliance placed, by the Petitioner, on Shri K.L. Bablani (supra) is misplaced. Firstly, this is the view of the CIC and does not bind this Court. What can, however, be relied upon are the reasons contained in this decision to persuade this Court to form its view. The CIC held that the file notings relating to vigilance matters, on the basis of which administrative/disciplinary action has been taken may not be disclosed, except upon demonstration of public interest, as it could embarrass and put pressure on those making file notings regarding the officer whose conduct is under comment.\\n\\n48. The concerns expressed in, and which swayed the decision of the CIC in Shri K.L. Balbani (supra) relied upon by the Petitioner, can be met by resort to Section 10 of the Act. However, those concerns cannot be a good reason to altogether deny information which, otherwise, is not exempt from disclosure under the law. Consequently, the defence set up by the petitioner, founded upon clause (j) of Section 8(1) is not tenable in this case.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n14\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n49. The defences under Section 8(1)(e) and Section 8(1) (g) of the Act would also be of no avail to the Petitioner in the present case. This is so, not merely on account of it being an afterthought of the Petitioner to raise the same, but also because they are untenable in the facts of the present case.\\n\\n50. The over-riding public interest involved in the present case, as aforesaid, would render inoperative the exemption under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act. Even otherwise, the exemption under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act would not apply since the information sought by the Respondent is not held by, or available with the petitioner in its fiduciary capacity. The Supreme Court in CBSE vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay, (2011) 8 SCC 497, laid down the test of determining fiduciary relationship as follows; \"41. In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies can be said to act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to students who participate in an examination, as a government does while governing its citizens or as the present generation does with reference to the future generation while preserving the environment. But the words \\'information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship\\' are used in Section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act in its normal and well recognized sense, that is to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the actions of the fiduciary - a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically/infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a patient, an agent with reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another partner, a director of a company with reference to a share-holder, an executor with reference to a legatee, a receiver with reference to the parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business dealings/transaction of the employer. We do not find that kind of fiduciary relationship between the examining body and the examinee, with reference to the evaluated answer-books, that come into the custody of the examining body.\"\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n51. In the present case it cannot be said that the opinion /advice tendered by the officers of the petitioner in respect of Sh. G.S. Narang was on account of their position as that of a \"beneficiary\" and that the position of the petitioner was that of a \"trustee\". The officers concerned who were involved in the opinion/advice making process acted in the discharge of their official/public duties. In any event, as aforesaid, the interest of such an officer can be effectively and sufficiently safeguarded by resort to Section 10 of the Act.\\n\\n52. Reliance is placed by the petitioner, on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs. Shaunak H. Satya & Ors., (2011) 8 SCC 781. The Supreme Court, in the said decision, while referring to the test laid down in the Aditya Bandopadhyay (supra), observed as under:\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n15\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n\"21. The instructions and \\'solutions to questions\\' issued to the examiners and moderators in connection with evaluation of answer scripts, as noticed above, is the intellectual property of ICAI. These are made available by ICAI to the examiners and moderators to enable them to evaluate the answer scripts correctly and effectively, in a proper manner, to achieve uniformity and consistency in evaluation, as a large number of evaluators and moderators are engaged by ICAI in connection with the evaluation. The instructions and solutions to questions are given by the ICAI to the examiners and moderators to be held in confidence. The examiners and moderators are required to maintain absolute secrecy and cannot disclose the answer scripts, the evaluation of answer scripts, the instructions of ICAI and the solutions to questions made available by ICAI, to anyone. The examiners and moderators are in the position of agents and ICAI is in the position of principal in regard to such information which ICAI gives to the examiners and moderators to achieve uniformity, consistency and exactness of evaluation of the answer scripts. When anything is given and taken in trust or in confidence, requiring or expecting secrecy and confidentiality to be maintained in that behalf, it is held by the recipient in a fiduciary relationship.\" (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n53. The aforesaid observation of the Supreme Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (Supra) does not render support to the contention of the Petitioner in claiming exemption from disclosing the opinion/recommendations tendered by it to the Ministry. It is not the case of the petitioner that the files notings containing the opinions/views of its officers, and the ultimate final opinion/recommendation tendered by it to the Ministry were confidential or secret.\\n\\n54. It is pertinent to note that there is no bar, per se, to the furnishing of opinions and advices in response to an application under the Act. The Supreme Court in Khanapuram Gandaiah vs. Administrative Officer, (2010) 2 SCC 1, while referring to Section 2\\n\\n(f) of the Act, which defines „information(cid:129), held as under:\\n\\n\"10. x x x x x x x x x This definition shows that an applicant under Section 6 of the RTI Act can get any information which is already in existence and accessible to the public authority under law. Of course, under the RTI Act an applicant is entitled to get copy of the opinions, advices, circulars, orders, etc., but he cannot ask for any information as to why such opinions, advices, circulars, orders, etc. have been passed, especially in matters pertaining to judicial decisions.\" (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n55. Therefore, what emerges from the aforesaid is that opinions/advices tendered/given by the officers (public officials) can be sought for under the Act, provided the same have not been tendered in confidence/secrecy and in trust to the authority concerned, i.e. to say- in a fiduciary relationship. Since the petitioner has not been able to set up the same in the present case, as aforesaid, the claim of exemption under Section 8(1)(e) stands rejected.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n16\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n56. A bare perusal of Section 8(1)(g) of the Act, makes it clear that the exemption would come into operation only if the disclosure of information would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or would identify the source of the information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes. The opinion/advice, which constitutes the information in the present case, cannot be said to have been given \"in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes\", as aforesaid. Therefore, that part of the clause would be inapplicable and irrelevant in the present case. So far as the petitioner(cid:129)s submission- that the disclosure of Information would endanger the life and safety of the officers who tendered their opinion/advices- is concerned, the same in my considered opinion, as aforesaid, in the facts of the present case, may be addressed- by resort to Section 10 of the Act. The exemption under Section 8(1)(g) of the Act, therefore, as claimed by the Petitioner, would be no ground for disallowing the disclosure of the information (sought by the Respondent) in the facts of the present case.\\n\\n57. At this stage, I may take note of the fact that the petitioner herein tendered to this court, after the judgment in the present case had been reserved, decisions of the CIC- wherein information sought by RTI applicants with regard to disciplinary proceedings of charged officers, were held to be exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(h) of the Act on the grounds that the disciplinary proceedings/investigation were ongoing, and as such, disclosure of information sought would impede the process of investigation.\\n\\n58. The said argument cannot be availed of by the petitioner herein as it was not raised at any stage (before and after the filing of the present petition), and no opportunity was afforded to the respondent herein to meet the same. Moreover, on the facts of this case, the argument premised upon clause (h) of Section 8(1) cannot be sustained. The information sought at point „B(cid:129) relates to t h e n o t e s h e e t s a n d f i n a l o p i n i o n r e n d e r e d b y t h e U P S C r e g a r d i n g i m p o s i t i o n o f penalty/punishment on the charged offer. Such information, as is evident from a plain reading, relates to notings and opinion post investigation i.e., after the investigation is complete. Disclosure of such information cannot, be any means whatsoever be held to \"impede the process of investigation\" which could be raised only when an investigation is ongoing. As such the exemption under Section 8(1)(h) of the Act also cannot be raised in by the petitioner in the present case.\\n\\n59. The petitioner(cid:129)s submission that the order of the CIC is unsustainable in as much as it is contrary to the decisions of the concurrent benches of the CIC is neither here nor there. The impugned decision of the CIC had been made specifically in the facts and circumstances of the present case. As regards the Petitioner(cid:129)s submission that the CIC(cid:129)s decision (Impugned order) is unsustainable since it was rendered while this Court was seized of a similar issue in UPSC v. C.L. Sharma (supra)- is concerned, the same in my view is entirely untenable. The pendency of the same issue in other cases before this Court does not preclude the CIC from dealing with the issues arising before it, unless there is a restraint on the CIC from doing so. There is nothing on record to suggest that this Court has, in UPSC v. C.L. Sharma (supra), put a blanket restraint on the CIC from dealing with the claim of exemption under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. Therefore, the said submission also stands rejected.\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n17\\n\\nUpsc vs Rk Jain on 13 July, 2012\\n\\n60. In view of above, the decision of the CIC is upheld, subject to the modification that the petitioner may, examine the case with regard to applicability of Section 10 of the Act, in relation to the names of the officers who may have acted in the process of opinion formation while dealing with the case of charged officer Sh.G.S. Narang.\\n\\n61. The petition is accordingly disposed of. The interim order stands vacated.\\n\\n(VIPIN SANGHI) JUDGE JULY 13, 2012 SR/\\'BSR\\'\\n\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175012216/\\n\\n18\\n\\n1AFR\\n\\nVidyadhar Mishra S/o Satyadev Mishra Aged About 68 Years R/o In front of Railway Station Raipur Dist.

The petitioner initially on 24/09/2013 sought information that at village Fafadih Tahsil & District Raipur, Mr. Satyadev and Jagnarayan son of Raja ram Mishra owned a land bearing Khasra No. 2292 ad-meauring 2.02 acres. It was stated that the said land was sold between the year 1935 and 1943 and\\n\\nOrder On Board\\n\\n09-05-2019\\n\\nWPC No. 997 of 2019\\n\\nHIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH, BILASPUR\\n\\n2two informations/details were sought i.e., (A) in between period of 1935-1943 on what date parts of land were sold and to whom ?(B) The certified copies of the sale deeds thereof may be provided.2.The said application was rejected by the Information Officer of the office of Sub-Registrar, Raipur on 11/10/2013. The petitioner preferred First Appeal before the appellate authority i.e. Registrar under Section 19 of the Right to Information Act on 02/11/2013. The appellate authority too dismissed the appeal and thereafter the second appeal was preferred before the Chief Information Commissioner on 04/2/2014. The said appeal was dismissed by impugned order dated 24/05/2014 on the ground that particulars of the information sought for has not been provided and information so required is in the form of questionnaire and therefore the information can not be supplied. 3.Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the information so sought for is comprised within the records of Sub- Registrar and it will be covered under the definition of of 2(f) of the Right to Information Act 2005 as such by denial of information, the illegality has been committed. Consequently the respondent may be directed to supply such information to the petitioner.4.Shri Kshitij Sharma, Advocate, was requested to assist the Court and was appointed as Amicus Curiae. He argued the case at length. Referring to definition under sub-section (f) & (g) of section 2 of the Act, it is contended that the information under the Act of\\n\\n32005 can only be furnished when the authorities are required to keep the same and they are required to maintain such information in their official records under the particular Act itself or any other law. It is further submitted that since the case pertains to registration of immovable property consequently it will have reference to Indian Registration Act and the rules made there-under. Referring to Section 51, 55 & 57 of the Indian Registration Act, it is stated that the particulars so sought for do not fall categorically under the said Sections since no particulars were given about the transaction. It is further submitted that Section 57 of the Registration Act 1908, the petitioner could have searched the documents and thereafter could have given the particulars with respect to the Rules framed under the Act, styled as C. G. Registration Rules 1939. It is contended that Rule 87 of Rules 1939 mandates that the books and index shall be kept in the Registration Office which do not particularly require and if it is read with Appendix B which is form of Book No.1 it only contemplates the name of Village, Tahsil and District i.e., territorial description and nature and value of the instrument. Therefore, to obtain information of the like nature, the petitioner should have established that the information which is sought for is preexisting on the record. The reliance was placed in (2011) 8 SCC 497 Para 63 & 67 – Central Board of Secondary Education Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay and submits that under the circumstances, if such a request for information as sought by way of indiscriminate and impractical demands or direction under the RTI Act is acceded to, it would be counter productive as it would adversely affect the\\n\\n4efficiency of the public authority and result in the executive/public authority getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. Therefore, the order dated 24.05.2014 is well merited. 5.Counsel for respondent No. 1 would submit that the information sought for was in form of questionnaire and in absence of any particulars the Public Officer is not expected to search for on behalf of the petitioner and thereafter give the information. He further submits that if such request is acceded to then the particular government office will be completely rendered non-productive. Learned State counsel also supports the contention of the respondents.6.Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents. parties.7.The information which was sought for by the petitioner was in respect of the query that one Satya Dev and Jagnarayan son of Rajaram Mishra owned a land bearing Khasra No. 2292 ad-meauring 2.02 acres at village Fafadih, Tahsil & District Raipur wherein petitioner sought for information that in between the period of 1935-1943 how many sales were made and to whom and how much parts were sold ?8.The second information was sought for as to when the particulars of such sale deeds are recovered then the certified copy of such sale deeds be supplied to him. The said application was dismissed by the information officer which was subject of First Appeal and the First Appellate Authority too dismissed the contention of the\\n\\n5petitioner which was further taken up in the Second Appeal wherein the impugned order dated 24/05/2014 was passed.9.Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act 2005 defines the “information” which reads as under :“Information” means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force”10. Section 2(j) defines the Right to Information. The reading of Section 2(f) would show that information which is sought for must be pre-exisiting on the records of the public authorities under any law for the time being in force. Since the issue in hand relates to registration of the sale deed by the office of Sub Registrar and the information was sought for, section 51 of the Registration Act 1908 would be relevant which reads as under :51. Register-books to be kept in the several offices.- (1) The following books shall be kept in the several offices hereinafter named, namely :-A-- In all registration offices --Book 1, “Register of non-testamentary documents relating to immovable property”.Book 2, “Record of reasons for refusal to register”Book 3, “Register of wills and authorities to adopt” and Book Book 4, “Miscellaneous Register”.B-In the offices of Registrars –Book 5, “Register of deposits of wills”11.The query of petitioner would fall under the Book-1 which relates\\n\\n6to Register of non-testamentary documents relating to immovable property. Thereafter, section 52 of the Registration Act 2008 speaks of the duties of registering officers when document is presented and thereafter section 55 would be relevant which speaks of “indexes” to be made by the registering offices and their contents. Relevant part of section 55 for the purpose of this case is reproduced here-in-below :“55. Indexes to be made by registering officers, and their contents.-- (1) Four such indexes shall be made in all registration offices, and shall be named respectively, Index No.1, Index No.II, Index No.III and Index No.IV.(2) Index No.I shall contain the names and additions of all the persons executing and of all persons claiming under every document entered or memorandum filed in Book No.1”12.Section (2) of section 55 stipulates that Index No.1 shall contain the names of and additions of all persons who execute the document. Index No.II shall contain such particulars mentioned in section 21. The Rules which is framed and styled as C.G. Registration Rules, 1939. Rule 87 mandates that the books and indexes shall be kept in registration offices and the Appendix -B which forms registration of book etc., would show that the registering officer is required to record the names of territorial description of the property. The information which was sought for by the petitioner was in nature of questionnaire meaning thereby in order to provide the information, the office of Sub-Registrar was required to make a search on behalf of the petitioner and thereafter take out the information and then supply it to petitioner. Section 57 of the Registration Act, 1908 prescribed that subject to\\n\\n7previous payments of the fee, Book Nos. 1 & 2 and the Indexes relating to Book No.1 shall be open to inspection by any person applying to inspect the same. 13.In the instant case, it appears that from the kind of information as sought for, the petitioner wanted to pass his questionnaire buck on the registration office so as to search out the sale made in a particular period and thereafter give this information by obtaining the copy of it. If such request is acceded to by indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act for disclosure of such information, then in view of the expression made by the Supreme Court in (2001) 8 SCC 497, it would be a counter productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of administration of public authority and further result in executive or public authority getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. For ready reference, Paras 63 & 66 of the said decision are relevant and quoted below:“63. At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about the RTI Act. The RTI Act provides access to all information that is available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the definitions of “information” and “right to information” under clauses (f) and (j) of Section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics an applicant may access such information, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non-available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences\\n\\n8and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide “advice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any “opinion or “advice” to an applicant. The reference to “opinion” or “advice” in the definition of “information” in Section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public authority. Many public authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act.”“67. Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counterproductive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising “information furnishing” at the cost of their normal and regular duties.”14.In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in C.B.S.E. v. Aditya Bandopadhyay (supra) the information so sought for by the petitioner was in questionnaire in nature and unless and until it is established that certain information exists in the documents, in the index, the officers cannot be directed to make a roving enquiry on behalf of the petitioner to make such information available to\\n\\n9him. When the Act provides means and measure to get the information as a statutory right then instead of doing it in self, it cannot be passed on to the officer of department to do so in the garb of RTI Act 2005. The RTI cannot be misused to pass on a duty of applicant to be done by officer concerned and to allow enjoy a joy ride to the petitioner. The application itself was misconceived. Hence, the order impugned do not require any interference. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.15. Before parting with the case, the Court extends sincere thanks to Mr. Kshitij Sharma, Amicus Curiae for rendering valuable assistance to the Court.Sd/-GOUTAM BHADURIR a o JUDGEBook\\n\\nJUDGMENT\\n\\n1. In the present petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, the petitioner has prayed to set aside order dated 26.02.2013 passed by the Central Information Commissioner-respondent No.3 herein. The petitioner has further prayed for setting aside order dated 22.09.2009 as also order dated 14.12.2010 passed by respondent No.1 herein-Public Information Officer and respondent No.2-appellate authority under the Right to Information Act, 2005, respectively. A direction is also prayed for against respondent Nos.1 and 2 requiring them to supply information to the petitioner demanded by the petitioner.\\n\\n2. The impugned order dated 26.02.2013 passed by the Central Information Commissioner in its relevant and material part reads as under:\\n\\n\"6. The Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in the case of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande dated October 3, 2012 had observed that Income Tax Returns was personal information and exempt from disclosure u/s 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act unless it was felt that a larger public interest was served. In the instant case, no such larger public interest has been shown. The ratio of the above case applies to the present appeal. The Commission concurs with the decision of the AA and the appeal is disposed of.\"\\n\\n3. It appears that the petitioner filed an application dated 01.09.2010 under the Right to Information Act, 2005 before the Public Information Officer of the office of the Commissioner of Income Tax, Surat, seeking certain information which included copies of income-tax returns of private respondent Nos. 4 to 8 herein. The petitioner in his application under Section 6 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as \"the RTI Act\") stated about following details of information asked for: \"Kindly find enclosed herewith the press cutting regarding the income tax violation by Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, resident of 50, Adarsh Society, Athwa Lines, Surat and Bhadreshkumar Chimanlal Kagalwala, resident of 50, Adarsh Society, Athwa Lines, Surat. Kindly find enclosed herewith the relevant documents regarding three different proceedings–(1) regarding becoming the agriculturist on the basis of the Will of one Lalabhai Kikabhai in the year 1981 by aforesaid two persons and other associates namely Harishchandra Chhaganlal Jani, Resident of 6/D Rudraksh Apartment, Opp. Arihant Complex, Parle point, Surat; Pankajbhai Harishchandra Jani, Resident of 6/D Rudraksh Apartment, Opp. Arihant Complex, Parle Point, Surat; Pravinchandra Thakorlal Dalal, resident of 10/B Rudraksha Apartment, Near Hotel Holiday Inn, Athwa Lines, Surat; Balkrishna Thakore; (2) becoming the agriculturist on the basis of the Will of one Mansinh Dharsinh after the year 1977 and purchasing the agricultural land at village: Kosamba in the year 1988. It is claimed by all these people that they were agriculturists and were doing the agriculture activities right from their birth which is a claim made before the Civil Court in Probate Application No. 21 of 1991. However, before the Revenue Authorities their claim was based on the Will of the deceased Lallubhai in the year 1981 wherein no such claim of being the agriculturists or holding the agriculture land from the childhood was made. In the order by the Additional Mamlatdar and Krushi Panch in Ganot Case No. 94 of 2003 they claimed to be the agriculturists and account holder right from the birth and even claimed that their father and forefather were also agriculturists. Thus, everywhere there are different false claims made before the different authorities and fraud is played by all these people upon the Revenue Authorities as well as the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal. From the press reports, it is very clear that there is serious violation of Income Tax Act on the part of these people and if the following information is supplied to the applicant, such fraudsters will be further exposed and their scandal in violation of the various laws of the State Government and Central Government may be surfaced.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIt is requested to supply the copies of the income tax returns with all annexures regarding all aforesaid persons namely Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, Bhadreshkumar Chimanlal Kagalwala, Harishchandra Chhaganlal Jani, Pankajbhai Harishchandra\\n\\nJani, Pravinchandra Thakorlal Dalal and Balkrishna Thakore from the year 1980 to 2010 so that whether these people were holding any agriculture land as claimed before the Revenue Authority can be ascertained, whether they had any agricultural income or not can be ascertained, whether on the basis of the so-called bogus Wills how many agricultural lands purchased by such non-agriculturists, were sold by them in violation of the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act can be ascertained, whether these persons have shown any agricultural income so as to avoid the payment of income tax, on their business income.\\n\\n(2) Kindly note that the provisions of Sections 8, 9, 11 and 24 are not attracted in the present case. If the information is supplied it will expose the misdeeds committed by the aforesaid persons before the Revenue Authorities and before the Income Tax Authority and, therefore, the supply of the information would be in public interest also. There is no question of any harm in disclosing the information to such people inasmuch as the public interest in discloser outweighs the harm to the protected interest of such individual persons. According to my knowledge, the information provided in the form of income tax returns is not treated as confidential by the aforesaid parties but even if it is treated as confidential the same can be given by your office under Section 11 of the Act. At the instance of Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval and his associates I am falsely involved in criminal cases and my human rights are violated and, therefore even according to Section 24 of the Act information requires to be supplied and under first proviso of sub-section (1) of section 7, the information is required to be supplied within 48 hours of the receipt of this request.\"\\n\\n3.1 It appears that between the petitioner and private respondents there simmered a property dispute and proceedings before the revenue authority with regard to the property bearing survey No.64, Block No. 160 situated at Village Bharthana Taluka Choryasi District Surat, have been pending. The facts relating to the kind, nature and contours of the said civil dispute could be gathered from the pleadings of Special Civil Application No. 14842 of 2010 filed by this very petitioner wherein private respondents herein are also party respondents. Copy of said Special Civil Application NO. 14842 of 2010 is made part of the record of this petition. It appears that the private respondents have claimed that they have become the owners of the agricultural land being survey No.64, Block No.160 of Village Bharthana, Taluka Choryasi, Surat, by virtue of Will executed by deceased Lalabhai Kikabhai who expired on 28.06.1981 and entry in the revenue record was effected in favour of the respondents. The Will was registered on 05.09.1981 after 2½ years from the date of death of Lalabhai. The present petitioner has disputed the said Will. The proceedings before the revenue authority are afoot between the parties. The entry No.690 which was recorded pursuant to the Will came to be upheld by the Mamlatdar, but the Deputy Collector cancelled the same.\\n\\n3.2 In the aforementioned Special Civil Application No.14842 of 2010 preferred by the petitioner, the pleadings set out in detail reveal the dispute between the petitioner and the respondents with regard to the said Will. In the said petition, the petitioner has prayed for a direction to the respondent authorities to hold inquiry in the matter of purchase of different agricultural lands by the private respondents and to consider petitioner\\'s various applications made requesting for investigation. As noted above, the case of the petitioner is about creation of fraudulent documents by the private respondents and regarding purchase of agricultural land since 1977 till date in the different villages of Surat on the basis of a Will.\\n\\n3.3 Coming back to the controversy, respondent No.1-Public Information Officer denied the information on the ground that Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act exempted the information asked for by the petitioner. The petitioner preferred first appeal before the appellate authority-Joint Commissioner of Income Tax. The first appellate authority taking view that the information asked for was in respect of third parties,\\n\\nissued notice for their objection or consent for giving the information. All the private parties about whom the information was sought for, attended the proceedings and filed written submissions and objected to parting of the information in favour of the petitioner. The first appellate authority thereafter dismissed the appeal on the ground that the case falls within the purview of Section 8(e) of the Act. It appears that against the said order of the first appellate authority, the petitioner had filed Special Civil Application No. 3275 of 2011. The same was withdrawn as per order dated 11.03.2011 for approaching the appropriate authority. The petitioner thereafter preferred second appeal under Section 9 of the Act before the Central Information Commission. It is the order of the Central Information Commission dated 26.02.2013, which is the subject matter of consideration having been impugned in this petition.\\n\\n4. Learned advocate Mr. N. M. Kapadia for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that it was unreasoned order. According to him, it was cryptic in nature. He relied on decision of the Supreme Court in Namita Sharma v. Union of India [2013] 1 SCC 745, in particular paragraphs 98, 99 and 100 thereof, to pinpoint the importance of providing reasons in the order which may be passed by the judicial or quasi-judicial forum. It was submitted that the Central Information Commission being the quasi-judicial commission, was duty bound to pass reasoned order and the impugned order being non-speaking one, was liable to be quashed on that ground itself, submitted learned advocate for the petitioner. 4.1 Learned advocate for the petitioner further submitted that authorities have relied on different grounds to deny the information. It was submitted that the Public Information Officer did not accept the request for furnishing information on the ground that the information requested for was exempted under Section 8 of the Right to Information Act; whereas the first appellate authority took it on a different ground and rejected the appeal. Learned advocate in the next submitted that the information asked for was the copies of Income-Tax Returns and furnishing of which had a public interest aspect. According to learned advocate, the private parties whose details and the copies of Returns were asked for, had committed illegality in getting declared for themselves a status of agriculturists. He submitted that from the information, if supplied, fraudulent conduct of the said parties would come to fore. It was therefore submitted by learned advocate that respondent No.3 wrongly applied decision of the Supreme Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commissioner [2013] 351 ITR 472/[2012] 211 Taxman 46/25 taxmann.com 525 to dismiss the appeal of the petitioner. It was the submission of learned advocate for the petitioner that the information asked for by the petitioner herein, would have, when supplied, served the public interest, therefore even if the information was relating to the private parties, it was not exempted from being supplied under Section 8(j) of the Act as in disclosure thereof, there was an overriding public interest. Learned advocate therefore submitted that respondent No.3-Central Information Commissioner erred in appreciating the facts of the case vis-à-vis the ratio of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) to hold that there was no larger public interest to be served.\\n\\n5. As seen above, the information in the present case asked for by the petitioners pertains to private parties, namely Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, Bhadresh Chimanlal Kagadwala, Harish Chhaganlal Jani, Pankajbhai Harishchandra Jani and Pravinchandra Thakorebhai Dalal. The petitioners asked for copies of Income-Tax Returns together with the annexures of the said parties for the period from 1980 to 2010. The said information was demanded by the petitioner on the plea that the private parties had conducted themselves illegally and fraudulently, that they had acquired a status of agriculturists for themselves on the basis of a Will of one Lalabhai which was not genuine, and that they had raised different pleas in different proceedings initiated by them before the different authorities for asserting and claiming the status as agriculturists. As was also noticed that Special Civil Application No.14842 of 2010 was filed against the said private parties seeking prayers to hold inquiry and investigate in respect of the orders passed by the Revenue Tribunal in favour of the said private parties. The petitioner\\'s say while demanding the information in question before the information authorities was that disclosure of the information\\n\\ndemanded would help to ascertain whether those parties had shown any agriculture income in their Income-Tax Returns and thereby avoided paying the income-tax.\\n\\n5.1 Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 enlists categories of information which are exempted from disclosure and for which the authorities are not under obligation to part with. Clause (j) of Section 8 is with regard to the information which is personal information in nature. The relevant provision of Section 8 is extracted herein:\\n\\n\"8. Exemption from disclosure of information.—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen—\\n\\n(e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\\n\\n(g) information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes;\\n\\n(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\"\\n\\n5.2 From the above provision, it is clear that the information which is personal information having no relationship with any public activity and having no nexus with public interest, the information which would result into unwarranted invasion of privacy, are not liable to be disclosed, the caveat being if the Information Officer/Appellate Authority is satisfied that in disclosure of such information larger public interest would be served. In other words, if larger public interest justifies the disclosure of personal information, the same may be allowed to be disclosed and the same may be furnished.\\n\\n5.3 The Apex Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) had an occasion to consider the scope, purport and import of Section 8(1)(j). In that case, the petitioner had sought for copies of memos, show cause notices and the letter of censure/punishment awarded to the government officer by his employer, the details of movable and immovable properties of the government officer, his investments, loans and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions, gifts issued by him and his family members at his son\\'s marriage, etc. This information had found place in the Income-Tax Returns. The Supreme Court treated it to be a personal information exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.\\n\\n5.3.1 The Apex Court stated:\\n\\n\\'The performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression \"personal information\", the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of right.\\' (Para 12)\\n\\n5.3.2 It was held:\\n\\n\\'The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are \"personal information\" which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger\\n\\npublic interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\\' (Para 13)\\n\\n6. Now, turning to the facts of the present case, it is evident that the kind and nature of the information demanded by the petitioner clearly falls within the expression \"personal information\". The personal character of the information demanded in the nature of Income-Tax Returns of the private parties to get disclosure about the payment of tax by them which was again in order to know about their status as agriculturists declared to be so by the authorities in the legal proceedings, could be indeed said to be personal. It was in the background of litigation between the petitioner and the said private persons relating to their property rights wherein the Will in favour of private parties was disputed and the disputes of civil nature were being agitated before the forum concerned and the court. This information being personal in nature, could not be claimed as a matter of right by the petitioner, rather they were clearly exempted information under Section 8(1)(j). The contention of larger public interest justifying the disclosure does not exist. In disclosing the said information asked for by the petitioner relating to the private parties, there was no element of public interest to be sub-served. The information was personal information relating to third parties. The attendant facts and circumstances and the litigation between the petitioner and those parties, instead indicated that the information was personal information which was asked for by the petitioner for his own personal interest and private purpose. Respondent No.3-Central Information Commissioner was eminently justified in taking a view that there was no public interest present in the information claimed to be supplied, rightly denying the same by dismissing the appeal.\\n\\n7. Lastly but importantly, dealing with the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned order passed by the Central Information Commission was an unreasoned order, and therefore the same was required to be set aside, it was not possible to countenance the same. It is correct to view the impugned order as one not providing reasons or to perceive it to be a cryptic or an unreasoned order. 7.1 An order which discloses a reason, may be a one-line reason, is a reasoned order. If the reason supplied by the authority for its decision answers the issue, howsoever short it may be, it would satisfy the requirements of being a speaking order. Where an application of mind is disclosed and a conclusion is supported in certain credible and convincing way, it amounts to supplying reasons. An order which is communicative for the ground on which it is based can be said to be a speaking order and a reasoned order. It is the vitality of the reasons supplied, and not the verbosity in the reasons narrated, that matters. The impugned order mentions that in the petitioner\\'s case, no larger interest was shown, therefore as held by the Supreme Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra), in view of the provisions of section 8(1)(j) of the Act, the information was exempt from disclosure. This order can be hardly characterized as an unreasoned order, much less a cryptic order. When the order in question supplies and communicates a ground that the decision taken is based on the ratio of the decision by the Apex Court decision, it would be a good, adequate and wholesome reasoning. Such order can be said to be eminently a reasoned order.\\n\\n8. Learned advocate lastly requested that this Court may at least make certain observations that the revenue authorities before whom the proceedings are pending, may ask the respondents to produce the documents. The request is hardly deserves to be acceded. No such observation can be made in the present proceedings. The prayer is not only not justified, but it is beyond the scope of the subject matter of the present petition. Lastly, it was submitted by learned advocate for the petitioner that he wanted to restrict his prayer for seeking information limited to certain documents and that in view of limited prayer restricted in the information, the court may direct the information authorities to supply such information. This request again cannot be accepted. If the petitioner wants certain documents and information independently, it is always open to take recourse to the relevant provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005 by applying before the competent authority and pursue his request for getting such information in accordance with law.\\n\\n9. For the foregoing reasons and discussion, petition deserves to be dismissed at the threshold. Accordingly this petition stands dismissed summarily.\\n\\nState\\n\\nRTI Application Fees\\n\\nGujarat\\n\\n20\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh\\n\\nVillage - Na Mandal- 5 Rest - 10\\n\\nAndaman\\n\\n10\\n\\nArunachal Pradesh 10\\n\\nBihar\\n\\n10\\n\\nChhattisgarh\\n\\n10\\n\\nRTI Appeal Fees\\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n50\\n\\n50\\n\\n50 (20 on govt site)\\n\\nWhether RTI of the State rules specify RTI has to be of one-subject matter ?\\n\\nDo not mention that information has to be limited to one- subject matter.
